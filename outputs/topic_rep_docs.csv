On a hydrogenated zigzag (armchair) edge, bright spots are (are not) observed together with (SQRT(3) by SQRT(3))R30 superlattice near the Fermi level (V_S = &#8722;30 mV for a peak of the local density of states (LDOS)) under UHV, demonstrating that a zigzag edge is responsible for the edge states, although there is no appreciable difference between as-prepared zigzag and armchair edges in air. Even in hydrogenated armchair edge, however, bright spots are observed at defect points, at which partial zigzag edges are created in the armchair edge.",Observation of zigzag and armchair edges of graphite using scanning   tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
0,2,0503569v2,"Although not an intrinsic superconductor, it has been long--known that, when intercalated with certain dopants, graphite is capable of exhibiting superconductivity. Of the family of graphite--based materials which are known to superconduct, perhaps the most well--studied are the alkali metal--graphite intercalation compounds (GIC) and, of these, the most easily fabricated is the C${}_8$K system which exhibits a transition temperature $\bm{T_c\simeq 0.14} $K. By increasing the alkali metal concentration (through high pressure fabrication techniques), the transition temperature has been shown to increase to as much as $\bm 5 $K in C${}_2$Na. Lately, in an important recent development, Weller \emph{et al.} have shown that, at ambient conditions, the intercalated compounds \cyb and \cca exhibit superconductivity with transition temperatures $\bm{T_c\simeq 6.5} $K and $\bm{11.5} $K respectively, in excess of that presently reported for other graphite--based compounds. We explore the architecture of the states near the Fermi level and identify characteristics of the electronic band structure generic to GICs. As expected, we find that charge transfer from the intercalant atoms to the graphene sheets results in the occupation of the $\bm\pi$--bands. Yet, remarkably, in all those -- and only those -- compounds that superconduct, we find that an interlayer state, which is well separated from the carbon sheets, also becomes occupied. We show that the energy of the interlayer band is controlled by a combination of its occupancy and the separation between the carbon layers.",Electronic structure of superconducting graphite intercalate compounds:   The role of the interlayer state
0,3,0503570v1,"In this letter we report the discovery of superconductivity in the isostructural graphite intercalation compounds C6Yb and C6Ca, with transition temperatures of 6.5K and 11.5K respectively. A structural characterisation of these compounds shows them to be hexagonal layered systems in the same class as other graphite intercalates. If we assume that all the outer s-electrons are transferred from the intercalant to the graphite sheets, then the charge transfer in these compounds is comparable to other superconducting graphite intercalants such as C8K 1,2 . However, the superconducting transition temperatures of C6Yb and C6Ca are up to two orders of magnitude greater. Interestingly, superconducting upper critical field studies and resistivity measurements suggest that these compounds are significantly more isotropic than pure graphite. This is unexpected as the effect of introducing the intercalant is to move the graphite layer further apart.",Superconductivity in the Intercalated Graphite Compounds C6Yb and C6Ca
0,4,0503650v1,"The electronic structure and selected zone-center phonons in Yb graphite intercalation compound (YbC6) are investigated {theoretically} using density functional calculations and LDA+U approximation for Coulomb correlations in the f shell, and experimentally using angle-resolved photoemission. We find that both in LDA and LDA+U approach the Yb f states are fully occupied providing no evidence for mixed-valent behavior. The obtained theoretical results are in good agreement with photoemission experiments. The 4f states are considerably hybridized both with the Yb 5d and C 2p states resulting in a substantial admixture of Yb f at the Fermi level. Soft Yb phonons, given a noticeable presence of the Yb states at the Fermi level, are probably responsible for the superconductivity recently reported in YbC6.",Electrons and Phonons in YbC6

(2) If superconductivity is conventional, what are the relevant phonons? (3) Given extreme similarity between YbC$_6$ and CaCa$_6$, why their critical temperatures are so different? We address these questions on the basis of first-principles calculations and conclude that coupling with intercalant phonons is likely to be the main force for superconductivity in YbC$_6$ and CaC$_6$, but not in alkaline-intercalated compounds, and explain the difference in $T_c$ by the ``isotope effect'' due to the difference in Yb and Ca atomic masses.",Intercalant-Driven Superconductivity in YbC$_{6}$ and CaC$_{6}$
1,1,0501048v2,"The impinging solar wind and its magnetic field perturbed the Earth's magnetosphere and create magnetic storms and substorms. The Earth's magnetosphere expands (contracts) during periods of southward (northward) IMF. It is shown that these magnetospheric expansions and contractions account for poorly understood aspects of magnetic storm-substorm relationship, bifurcation of the magnetotail and the appearance of theta aurora. Quantitative theory and calculations in agreement with the suggested model of solar wind/IMF-magnetosphere coupling are presented. Pre-noon and post-noon dents on the magnetopause are expected to appear during a long period of strong northward IMF.

1,3,0502001v2,A catastrophe model for the onset of fast magnetic reconnection is presented that suggests why plasma systems with magnetic free energy remain apparently stable for long times and then suddenly release their energy. For a given set of plasma parameters there are generally two stable reconnection solutions: a slow (Sweet-Parker) solution and a fast (Alfv\'enic) Hall reconnection solution. Below a critical resistivity the slow solution disappears and fast reconnection dominates.

A monolayer of highly charged polymer microspheres, with a Yukawa interaction, was suspended in a plasma sheath. Two counter-propagating Ar laser beams pushed the particles, causing shear-induced melting of the monolayer and a shear flow in a planar Couette configuration. By fitting the particle velocity profiles in the shear flow to a Navier-Stokes model, the kinematic viscosity was calculated; it was of order 1 mm^2/s, depending on the monolayer's parameters and shear stress applied.",Shear Flows and Shear Viscosity in a Two-Dimensional Yukawa System   (Dusty Plasma)

Profiles as well as disturbances in dependent variables are followed, running the dynamical system to transport equilibrium. The third species density shows a significant correlation with that of the electrons, regardless of initial conditions and drive mechanisms. For decaying systems the densities evolve toward each other. Companion tests with a simple two dimensional drift wave model show this persists even if the third species is a passively advected test field.

A nearby quantum point contact allows us to track the charge as added to the device. If charged with only up to one electron, the low-energy spectrum of the double quantum dot is characterized by its quantum mechanical interdot tunnel splitting. We directly measure its magnitude by utilizing particular anticrossing features in the stability diagram at finite source-drain bias. By modification of gate voltages defining the confinement potential as well as by variation of a perpendicular magnetic field we demonstrate the tunability of the coherent tunnel coupling.",Direct control of the tunnel splitting in a one-electron double quantum   dot
2,3,0501046v1,"Inelastic spin relaxation and spin splitting $\epsilon_{\mathrm{s}}$ in lateral quantum dots are studied in the regime of strong in-plane magnetic field. Due to both g-factor energy dependence and spin-orbit coupling $\epsilon_{\mathrm{s}}$ demonstrates a substantial non-linear magnetic field dependence similar to that observed by R.Hanson \textit{et al} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{91}, 196802 (2003)]. It also varies with the in-plane orientation of magnetic field due to crystalline anisotropy of spin-orbit coupling. Spin relaxation rate is also anisotropic, the anisotropy increasing with the field. When the magnetic length is less than the 'thickness' of GaAs dot, the relaxation can be order of magnitude faster for $\mathbf{B}% \Vert\lbrack100]$ than for $\mathbf{B\Vert}[110]$.",Anisotropy of spin splitting and spin relaxation in lateral quantum dots
2,4,0501141v1,"We examine the full counting statistics of quantum dots, which display super-Poissonian shot noise. By an extension to a generic situation with many excited states we identify the underlying transport process. The statistics is a sum of independent Poissonian processes of bunches of different sizes, which leads to the enhanced noise. The obtained results could be useful to determine transport characteristics in molecules and large quantum dots, since the noise (and higher cumulants) allow to identify the internal level structure, which is not visible in the average current.",Full counting statistics of super-Poissonian shot noise in multi-level   quantum dots

In this paper we investigate various geometries of a SET in order to maximize the device's sensitivity to charge transfer between quantum dots. Through the use of finite element modeling we model the materials and geometries of an Al/Al2O3 SET measuring the state of quantum dots in the Si substrate beneath.

We find that the band-gaps are not as close to experiment as those obtained from previous pseudopotential EXX calculations. Full-potential band-gaps are also not significantly better for $sp$ semiconductors than for insulators, as had been found for pseudopotentials. The locations of $d$-band states, determined using the full-potential EXX method, are in excellent agreement with experiment, irrespective of whether these states are core, semi-core or valence.

We consider a situation when the KS equations are known to have a unique solution at high temperatures and this solution is a uniform particle density. We show that, at zero temperature, there are stable solutions that are not uniform. We provide the general principles behind this phenomenon, namely the conditions when it can be observed and how to construct these non-uniform solutions.

The main findings are that the KS exchange potential builds a significant barrier-like structure under slight population of the second subband, and that both the asymptotic value of the KS exchange potential and the inter-subband energy jump discontinuously at the one-subband (1S) -> two-subband (2S) transition.

4,4,0602003v1,"Metal-semiconductor contacts play a key role in electronics. Here we show that for quasi-one-dimensional structures such as nanotubes and nanowires, side contact with the metal only leads to weak band re-alignement, in contrast to bulk metal-semiconductor contacts. Schottky barriers are much reduced compared with the bulk limit, and should facilitate the formation of good contacts. However, the conventional strategy of heavily doping the semiconductor to obtain ohmic contacts breaks down as the nanowire diameter is reduced. The issue of Fermi level pinning is also discussed, and it is demonstrated that the unique density of states of quasi-one-dimensional structures makes them less sensitive to this effect. Our results agree with recent experimental work, and should apply to a broad range of quasi-one-dimensional materials.",Electrical contacts to nanotubes and nanowires: why size matters
4,5,0607131v1,"A series of molybdenum disulfide intercalation compounds was prepared to study the effect of varying loadings of the samples with intercalated molecules. The molecules, (5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11- tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,11-diene) macrocycles, occupy the gallery spaces between the MoS2 layers in a single layer. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetry, wide angle X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images reveal the layer stacking as the filling of the gallery spaces with macrocycles increases gradually up to one monolayer per gallery space. Fourier transforms of these images are in excellent agreement with the X-ray scattering of the bulk compound. X-ray scattering by these compounds was simulated by evaluating the Debye sum for weighted averages of model particles that have sequences of open and closed gallery spaces. Open and closed gallery spaces coexist in the samples with less than one monolayer of intercalated molecules per gallery space. The fraction of open gallery spaces increases with macrocycle loading, from zero for restacked MoS2 without macrocycles to one for a fully intercalated compound. The sequence of open and closed spaces is approximately random, and the MoS2 layers stack with the same orientation but with random lateral shifts.

5,3,0501521v1,"We discuss a free boundary problem for two moving solid-liquid interfaces that strongly interact via the diffusion field in the liquid layer between them. This problem arises in the context of liquid film migration (LFM) during the partial melting of solid alloys. In the LFM mechanism the system chooses a more efficient kinetic path which is controlled by diffusion in the liquid film, whereas the process with only one melting front would be controlled by the very slow diffusion in the mother solid phase. The relatively weak coherency strain energy is the effective driving force for LFM. As in the classical dendritic growth problems, also in this case an exact family of steady-state solutions with two parabolic fronts and an arbitrary velocity exists if capillary effects are neglected. We develop a velocity selection theory for this problem, including anisotropic surface tension effects. The strong diffusion interaction and coherency strain effects in the solid near the melting front lead to substantial changes compared to classical dendritic growth.",Velocity selection problem for combined motion of melting and   solidification fronts

5,5,0502023v1,"The aim of this paper is to study the elastic stress and strain fields of dislocations and disclinations in the framework of Mindlin's gradient elasticity. We consider simple but rigorous versions of Mindlin's first gradient elasticity with one material length (gradient coefficient). Using the stress function method, we find modified stress functions for all six types of Volterra defects (dislocations and disclinations) situated in an isotropic and infinitely extended medium. By means of these stress functions, we obtain exact analytical solutions for the stress and strain fields of dislocations and disclinations. An advantage of these solutions for the elastic strain and stress is that they have no singularities at the defect line. They are finite and have maxima or minima in the defect core region. The stresses and strains are either zero or have a finite maximum value at the defect line. The maximum value of stresses may serve as a measure of the critical stress level when fracture and failure may occur. Thus, both the stress and elastic strain singularities are removed in such a simple gradient theory.

It is shown that these systems are closely related to the quantum dimer model introduced by Rokhsar and Kivelson as an effective low-energy theory for valence bond states.",Quantum Disordered Ground States in Frustrated Antiferromagnets with   Multiple Ring Exchange Interactions
8,1,0501457v1,"Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the spreading of binary polymer nanodroplets in a cylindrical geometry. The polymers, described by the bead-spring model, spread on a flat surface with a surface-coupled Langevin thermostat to mimic the effects of a corrugated surface. Each droplet consists of chains of length 10 or 100 monomers with ~350,000 monomers total. The qualitative features of the spreading dynamics are presented for differences in chain length, surface interaction strength, and composition. When the components of the droplet differ only in surface interaction strength, the more strongly wetting component forms a monolayer film on the surface even when both materials are above or below the wetting transition. In the case where the only difference is the polymer chain length, the monolayer film beneath the droplet is composed of an equal amount of short chain and long chain monomers even when one component (the shorter chain length) is above the wetting transition and the other is not. The fraction of short and long chains in the precursor foot depends on whether or not both the short and long chains are in the wetting regime. Diluting the concentration of the strongly wetting component in a mixture with a weakly wetting component decreases the rate of diffusion of the wetting material to the surface and limits the spreading rate of the precursor foot, but the bulk spreading rate is not affected until the more strongly wetting component is removed completely.",Diverse Spreading Behavior of Binary Polymer Nanodroplets

A striking phenomenon is observed: splashing can be completely suppressed by decreasing the pressure of the surrounding gas. The threshold pressure where a splash first occurs is measured as a function of the impact velocity and found to scale with the molecular weight of the gas and the viscosity of the liquid. Both experimental scaling relations support a model in which compressible effects in the gas are responsible for splashing in liquid solid impacts.,Drop Splashing on a Dry Smooth Surface

Superhydrophobic CNT forests are obtained from a new and simple functionalization strategy, based on the gold-thiol affinity. Using a specifically devised experimental setup, we then show that these surfaces are able to withstand high excess pressures (larger than 10 kPa) without transiting toward a roughness-invaded state, therefore preserving their low adhesion properties. Together with the relatively low technical cost of the process, this robustness versus pressure makes such surfaces very appealing for practical integration into microfluidic systems.",Contact angle measurements on superhydrophobic Carbon Nanotube Forests :   effect of fluid pressure

Other experiments confirmed the theoretical prediction about the crucial role which the long range nature of the Coulomb interaction plays in the correlated electronic transport through a SWCNT with two intramolecular tunneling barriers. In order to investigate the effects on low dimensional electron systems due to the range of electron electron repulsion, we introduce a model for the interaction which interpolates well between short and long range regimes.

10,1,1607.04563v2,"Although Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are still the dominant tool for engineering design and analysis applications involving turbulent flows, standard RANS models are known to be unreliable in many flows of engineering relevance, including flows with separation, strong pressure gradients or mean flow curvature. With increasing amounts of 3-dimensional experimental data and high fidelity simulation data from Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), data-driven turbulence modeling has become a promising approach to increase the predictive capability of RANS simulations. Recently, a data-driven turbulence modeling approach via machine learning has been proposed to predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy of a given flow based on high fidelity data from closely related flows. In this work, the closeness of different flows is investigated to assess the prediction confidence a priori. Specifically, the Mahalanobis distance and the kernel density estimation (KDE) technique are used as metrics to quantify the distance between flow data sets in feature space. The flow over periodic hills at Re=10595 is used as the test set and seven flows with different configurations are individually used as training set. The results show that the prediction error of the Reynolds stress anisotropy is positively correlated with Mahalanobis distance and KDE distance, demonstrating that both extrapolation metrics can be used to estimate the prediction confidence a priori. A quantitative comparison using correlation coefficients shows that the Mahalanobis distance is less accurate in estimating the prediction confidence than KDE distance. The extrapolation metrics introduced in this work and the corresponding analysis provide an approach to aid in the choice of the data source and to assess the prediction confidence for data-driven turbulence modeling.",A Priori Assessment of Prediction Confidence for Data-Driven Turbulence   Modeling
10,2,1701.07102v2,"Although an increased availability of computational resources has enabled high-fidelity simulations of turbulent flows, the RANS models are still the dominant tools for industrial applications. However, the predictive capabilities of RANS models are limited by potential inaccuracy driven by hypotheses in the Reynolds stress closure. Recently, a Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) approach has been proposed to learn the functional form of Reynolds stress discrepancy in RANS simulations based on available data. It has been demonstrated that the learned discrepancy function can be used to improve Reynolds stresses in different flows where data are not available. However, owing to a number of challenges, the improvements have been demonstrated only in the Reynolds stress prediction but not in the corresponding propagated quantities of interest. In this work, we introduce the procedures toward a complete PIML framework for predictive turbulence modeling, including learning Reynolds stress discrepancy function, predicting Reynolds stresses in different flows, and propagating to mean flow fields. The process of Reynolds stress propagation and predictive accuracy of the propagated velocity field are investigated. To improve the learning-prediction performance, the input features are enriched based on an integrity basis of invariants. The fully developed turbulent flow in a square duct is used as the test case. The discrepancy model is trained on flow fields obtained from several Reynolds numbers and evaluated on a duct flow at a Reynolds number higher than any of the training cases. The predicted Reynolds stresses are propagated to velocity field through RANS equations. Numerical results show excellent predictive performances in both Reynolds stresses and their propagated velocities, demonstrating the merits of the PIML approach in predictive turbulence modeling.",A Comprehensive Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for   Predictive Turbulence Modeling

We stress that the deconvolution procedure proposed in this investigation is blind, i.e. the deconvolved field is computed without any pre-existing information about the filtering procedure or kernel. This may be conceptually contrasted to the celebrated approximate deconvolution approaches where a filter shape is predefined for an iterative deconvolution process. We demonstrate that the proposed blind deconvolution network performs exceptionally well in the a-priori testing of both two-dimensional Kraichnan and three-dimensional Kolmogorov turbulence and shows promise in forming the backbone of a physics-augmented data-driven closure for the Navier-Stokes equations.",A neural network approach for the blind deconvolution of turbulent flows
10,4,1710.09099v3,"We present an efficient deep learning technique for the model reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations for unsteady flow problems. The proposed technique relies on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the stochastic gradient descent method. Of particular interest is to predict the unsteady fluid forces for different bluff body shapes at low Reynolds number. The discrete convolution process with a nonlinear rectification is employed to approximate the mapping between the bluff-body shape and the fluid forces. The deep neural network is fed by the Euclidean distance function as the input and the target data generated by the full-order Navier-Stokes computations for primitive bluff body shapes. The convolutional networks are iteratively trained using the stochastic gradient descent method with the momentum term to predict the fluid force coefficients of different geometries and the results are compared with the full-order computations. We attempt to provide a physical analogy of the stochastic gradient method with the momentum term with the simplified form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes momentum equation. We also construct a direct relationship between the CNN-based deep learning and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism for the model reduction of a fluid dynamical system. A systematic convergence and sensitivity study is performed to identify the effective dimensions of the deep-learned CNN process such as the convolution kernel size, the number of kernels and the convolution layers. Within the error threshold, the prediction based on our deep convolutional network has a speed-up nearly four orders of magnitude compared to the full-order results and consumes an insignificant fraction of computational resources.

The composition was close to the pinch point of the three structure phase transitions in BaTiO3. Powder X-ray diffraction result indicated that the samples were in very slightly distorted rhombohedral structure at room temperature, and the dielectric measurement showed only cubic-to-rhombohedral phase transition occurred. Instead of a sharp peak characteristic of a ferroelectric (FE) transition, the large dielectric response was similar to those in nonferroelectric perovskites CaCu3Ti4O12, AFe1/2B1/2O3 (A=Ba, Sr, Ca; B=Nb, Ta, Sb) and IBLC (Internal Barrier Layer Capacitance) BaTiO3 based FE ceramics.

A Maxwell-Wagner type relaxation in the FE state was observed. Moreover, another relaxation mode appears from the vicinity of FE phase transition temperature TC, and extends over a narrow temperature range, with unusual slowing down of relaxation rate as temperature rises, which is contrary to what is commonly observed.

12,4,1311.1778v1,"The length scale of the magnetization gradients in chiral magnets is determined by the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Thus, even conventional spin-transfer torques are controlled by the relativistic spin-orbit coupling in these systems, and additional relativistic corrections to the current-induced torques and magnetization damping become important for a complete understanding of the current-driven magnetization dynamics. We theoretically study the effects of reactive and dissipative homogeneous spin-orbit torques and anisotropic damping on the current-driven skyrmion dynamics in cubic chiral magnets. Our results demonstrate that spin-orbit torques play a significant role in the current-induced skyrmion velocity. The dissipative spin-orbit torque generates a relativistic Magnus force on the skyrmions, whereas the reactive spin-orbit torque yields a correction to both the drift velocity along the current direction and the transverse velocity associated with the Magnus force. The spin-orbit torque corrections to the velocity scale linearly with the skyrmion size, which is inversely proportional to the spin-orbit coupling. Consequently, the reactive spin-orbit torque correction can be the same order of magnitude as the non-relativistic contribution. More importantly, the dissipative spin-orbit torque can be the dominant force that causes a deflected motion of the skyrmions if the torque exhibits a linear or quadratic relationship with the spin-orbit coupling.

Our result suggests that if the abrupt slowing down of glassy materials is indeed accompanied by the growth of a cooperative length ell, then the non-linear, 3 omega response to an oscillating field should substantially increase and give direct information on the temperature (or density) dependence of ell. The analysis of the non-linear compressibility or the dielectric susceptibility in supercooled liquids, or the non-linear magnetic susceptibility in spin-glasses, should give access to a cooperative length scale, that grows as the temperature is decreased or as the age of the system increases.

The solid branch terminates at the transition, while the fluid branch continues beyond the critical activity, describing a meta-stable super-cooled fluid. It terminates with density 0.85 (relative to the closest packing density) and finite entropy per site. This termination density is close to the random-closest-packing density of the glassy state obtained for infinitely-fast cooling.

A single qubit can be encoded nonlocally in a pair of spatially separated Majorana bound states. Such Majorana qubits are in demand as building blocks of a topological quantum computer, but direct experimental tests of the nonlocality remain elusive. Here we propose a method to probe the nonlocality by means of crossed Andreev reflection, which is the injection of an electron into one bound state followed by the emission of a hole by the other bound state (equivalent to the splitting of a Cooper pair over the two states). We have found that, at sufficiently low excitation energies, this nonlocal scattering process dominates over local Andreev reflection involving a single bound state. As a consequence, the low-temperature and low-frequency fluctuations $\delta I_{i}$ of currents into the two bound states $i=1,2$ are maximally correlated: $\overline{\delta I_{1}\delta I_{2}}=\overline{\delta I_{i}^{2}}$.",Splitting of a Cooper pair by a pair of Majorana bound states

The characteristic times for attaining equilibrium values of the gyration radius components perpendicular and parallel to the interface are predicted to scale with chain length $N$ and block length $M$ as $\tau_{\perp} \propto M^{1+2\nu}$ (here $\nu\approx 0.6$ is the Flory exponent) and as $\tau_{\parallel} \propto N^2$, although initially the rate of coil flattening is expected to decrease with block size as $\propto M^{-1}$. Since typically $N\gg M$ for multiblock copolymers, our results suggest that the flattening dynamics proceeds faster perpendicular rather than parallel to the interface.

The vortex response to the ac current is investigated by detailed measurements of the voltage output as a function of ac current amplitude, magnetic field and temperature. The measurements revealed pronounced voltage rectification effects which are mainly characterized by the two critical depinning forces of the asymmetric potential. The shape of the net dc voltage as a function of the excitation amplitude indicates that our vortex ratchet behaves in a way very different from standard overdamped models. Rather, as demonstrated by the observed output signal, the repinning force, necessary to stop vortex motion, is considerably smaller than the depinning force, resembling the behavior of the so-called inertia ratchets.

By integrating out ``bulk'' degrees of freedom away from the columnar defect we reduce this two-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional one, localized on the defect and exhibiting a long-range elasticity along the defect. We show that as a function of temperature, for a magnetic field aligned with the defect this system exhibits a one-dimensional analog of a roughening transition, with a low-temperature ``smooth'' phase corresponding to a vortex array pinned by the defect, and a high-temperature ``rough'' phase in which at long scales thermal fluctuations effectively average away the pinning by the defect. We also find that in the low-temperature pinned phase, the vortex lattice tilt response to a transverse magnetic field proceeds via a soliton proliferation transition, governed by an integrable sine-Hilbert equation and analogous to the well-known commensurate-incommensurate transition in sine-Gordon systems. The distinguishing feature here is the long-range nature of the one-dimensional elasticity, leading to a logarithmic soliton energy and interaction.

25,1,0908.3513v1,"Recent theories and experiments have suggested that strong spin-orbit coupling effects in certain band insulators can give rise to a new phase of quantum matter, the so-called topological insulator, which can show macroscopic entanglement effects. Such systems feature two-dimensional surface states whose electrodynamic properties are described not by the conventional Maxwell equations but rather by an attached axion field, originally proposed to describe strongly interacting particles. It has been proposed that a topological insulator with a single spin-textured Dirac cone interfaced with a superconductor can form the most elementary unit for performing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study and first-principle theoretical calculation-predictions that reveal the first observation of such a topological state of matter featuring a single-surface-Dirac-cone realized in the naturally occurring Bi$_2$Se$_3$ class of materials. Our results, supported by our theoretical predictions and calculations, demonstrate that undoped compound of this class of materials can serve as the parent matrix compound for the long-sought topological device where in-plane surface carrier transport would have a purely quantum topological origin.

They can all be smoothly connected to the same trivial product state if we break the symmetry. The Haldane phase of spin-1 chain is the first example of SPT phase which is protected by SO(3) spin rotation symmetry. The topological insulator is another exam- ple of SPT phase which is protected by U(1) and time reversal symmetries. It has been shown that free fermion SPT phases can be systematically described by the K-theory. In this paper, we show that interacting bosonic SPT phases can be systematically described by group cohomology theory: distinct d-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with on-site symmetry G (which may contain anti-unitary time reversal symmetry) can be labeled by the elements in H^{1+d}[G, U_T(1)] - the Borel (1 + d)-group-cohomology classes of G over the G-module U_T(1). The boundary excitations of the non-trivial SPT phases are gapless or degenerate. Even more generally, we find that the different bosonic symmetry breaking short-range-entangled phases are labeled by the following three mathematical objects: (G_H, G_{\Psi}, H^{1+d}[G_{\Psi}, U_T(1)], where G_H is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian and G_{\Psi} the symmetry group of the ground states.",Symmetry protected topological orders and the group cohomology of their   symmetry group
27,5,1108.3898v2,"There are several instances where quantum anomalies of continuous and discrete classical symmetries play an important role in fundamental physics. Examples come from chiral anomalies in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions and gravitational anomalies in string theories. Their generic origin is the fact that classical symmetries may not preserve the domains of quantum operators like the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show by simple examples that anomalous symmetries can often be implemented at the expense of working with mixed states having non-zero entropies. In particular there is the result on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be rectified by using impure states. We also argue that non-abelian groups of twisted bundles are always anomalous for pure states sharpening an earlier argument of Sorkin and Balachandran. This is the case of mapping class groups of geons indicating that ""large"" diffeos are anomalous for pure states in the presence of geons. Nevertheless diffeo invariance may be restored by using impure states. This work concludes with examples of these ideas drawn from molecular physics.   The above approach using impure states is entirely equivalent to restricting all states to the algebra of observables invariant under the anomalous symmetries. For anomalous gauge groups such as color, this would mean that we work with observables singlet under global gauge transformations. For color, this will mean that we work with color singlets, a reasonable constraint.",Mixed States from Anomalies

At zero temperature a variety of electronic phases as ferromagnetic (FM) charge ordered (CO) orbital ordered (OO), CE-CO-OO and FM metallic, are obtained. By raising the temperature the CE-CO-OO phase becomes paramagnetic (PM), but depending on the electron-phonon coupling and the exchange coupling the transition can be direct or trough intermediate states: a FM disorder metallic, a PM-CO-OO or a FM-CO-OO. We also discus the nature of the high temperature PM phase in the regime of finite electron phonon coupling. In this regime half of the oxygen octahedra surrounding the $Mn$ ions are distorted. In the weak coupling regime the octahedra are slightly deformed and only trap a small amount of electronic charge, rendering the system metallic consequentially.

Here we discuss a particular realization of a Weyl semimetal: a superlattice heterostructure, made of alternating layers of topological insulator (TI) and normal insulator (NI) material, introduced by one of us before. The Weyl node splitting is achieved most easily in this system by breaking time-reversal (TR) symmetry, for example by magnetic doping. If, however, spatial inversion (I) symmetry remains, the Weyl nodes will occur at the same energy, making it possible to align the Fermi energy simultaneously with both nodes. The goal of this work is to explore the consequences of breaking the I symmetry in this system. We demonstrate that, while this generally moves the Weyl nodes to different energies, thus eliminating nodal semimetal and producing a state with electron and hole Fermi surfaces, the topological properties of the Weyl semimetal state, i.e. the chiral edge states and the corresponding Hall conductivity, survive for moderate I symmetry breaking. Moreover, we demonstrate that a new topological phenomenon arises in this case, if an external magnetic field along the growth direction of the heterostructure is applied. Namely, this leads to an equilibrium dissipationless current, flowing along the direction of the field, whose magnitude is proportional to the energy difference between the Weyl nodes and to the magnetic field, with a universal coefficient, given by a combination of fundamental constants.",Weyl semimetal with broken time reversal and inversion symmetries

Unfortunately, the original methods suffer from the truncation-error being first-order accurate at all extrema despite the accuracy of the higher-order method. To remedy this problem, higher-order extensions were proposed that relied on elaborate analytic and geometric constructions. Since extremum-preserving limiters are applied only at extrema, additional computational cost is negligible. Therefore, extremum-preserving limiters ensure higher-order spatial accuracy while maintaining simplicity. This report presents higher-order limiting for (i) computing van Leer slopes and (ii) adjusting parabolic profiles. This limiting preserves monotonicity and accuracy at smooth extrema, maintains stability in the presence of discontinuities and under-resolved gradients, and is based on constraining the interpolated values at extrema (and only at extrema) by using nonlinear combinations of second derivatives. The van Leer limiting can be done separately and implemented in MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws) or done in concert with the parabolic profile limiting and implemented in PPM (Piecewise Parabolic Method). The extremum-preserving limiters elegantly fit into any algorithm which uses conventional limiting techniques. Limiters are outlined for scalar advection and nonlinear systems of conservation laws.

In contrast to previous studies, we focus on properties of this model in the experimentally relevant thermodynamic limit at finite temperature T. We find clear evidence for deviations from w_k-scaling of the conductivity towards w_k/T-scaling at low Matsubara frequencies w_k. By careful analytic continuation using Pade approximants we show that this behavior carries over to the real frequency axis where the conductivity scales with w/T at small frequencies and low temperatures.

Via Monte Carlo simulations of ensembles with fixed numbers of particles, we observe the behavior of the gap as a function of the tuning parameter for various strength of diagonal disorder. For weak disorder, we find that gapped Mott insulating phase is sustained up to the transition point and disappears only in a superfluid, strongly supporting a direct Mott-insulator-to-superfluid transition. Bose glass behavior, insulating with vanishing gap, appears only when the strength of disorder is bigger than a critical value.",The quasi-particle gap in a disordered boson Hubbard model in two   dimensions

In the experimentally relevant case of exponential decay, $J(t)\propto e^{-\gamma t}$, an adapted mean-field expansion for large fillings $n$ yields a scaling solution for the fluctuations. This enables us to analytically calculate the evolution of the number and phase variations (on-site) and correlations (off-site) for slow ($\gamma\ll\mu$), intermediate, and fast (non-adiabatic $\gamma\gg\mu$) sweeps, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential.

It is shown that the OSMT realizes two different coexistence regions at finite temperatures in accordance with the recent results of Liebsch. We further find that the particularly interesting behavior emerges around the special condition $U=U'$ and J=0, which includes a new type of the coexistence region with three distinct states.

On the mean-field level of this approach we investigate the Mott transition and observe both separate and joint transitions of the two bands depending on the choice of the inter- and intraorbital Coulomb interaction parameters. The mean-field calculations allow for a simple physical interpretation and can confirm several aspects of previous work. Beside the case of two individually half-filled bands we also examine what happens if the original metallic bands possess fractional filling either due to finite doping or due to a crystal field which relatively shifts the atomic energy levels of the two orbitals.

34,1,0501179v2,"Josephson effect in short ballistic SINIS and SIFIS double-tunnel junctions, consisting of clean superconductors (S), a normal metal (N) or metallic ferromagnet (F), and insulating interfaces (I) is studied. For SINIS double-tunnel junctions, sharp peaks in the critical Josephson current as a function of the junction width result from the resonant amplification of the Andreev process when the quasi-bound states enter the superconducting gap. For SIFIS double-tunnel junctions spin split quasi-bound states partially amplify the supercurrent and trigger the transitions between 0 and $\pi$ states of the junction. Instead of the critical current reaching a peak value (which happens when the Andreev states cross the Fermi surface in SINIS junctions), a narrow dip opens up exactly at the peak due to the compensation of partial currents flowing in opposite directions. This is related to the spin polarization of Andreev states and explains the coexistence of stable and metastable 0 and $\pi$ states in the vicinity of the transition. With increased barrier transparency, the described mechanism of $0-\pi$ transitions is modified by the broadening and overlapping of quasi-bound states (transmission resonances). Temperature-induced transitions both from 0 to $\pi$ and from $\pi$ to 0 states are studied by computing the phase diagram (temperature vs. junction width) for different interfacial transparencies varying from metallic (transparent) to the tunnel limit.",Resonant tunneling in short Josephson SFS junctions

From a calculation using the Discrete Dipole Approximation, we find that the surface plasmon splitting is largest for the boojum pair, intermediate for the homogeneous, and smallest for the baseball configuration. The boojum pair results are in good agreement with experiment.

The variations are qualitatively different depending on how the distance between patches compares to the extrapolation length of the stronger anchoring domain. Our results agree with those previously found in stripped patterns.

A primary motivation of this work was to determine to what extent the predictions of the electronically more realistic GGA+U treatment would differ from those obtained within the GGA. Several significant qualitative changes are found. For the pristine system in the rhombohedral structure, Mn ions show a high-spin state within GGA+U, rather than the low spin (metallic) state found in GGA. The doped rhombohedral structure is unstable within GGA+U, rather than metastable, as in GGA. In the monoclinic structure, the dopant oxidation states are the same (trivalent Fe, divalent Co, Ni) in GGA+U and GGA. Co and Ni ions show a higher spin state in GGA+U than in GGA. The divalent dopants destabilized the monoclinic structure to a greater extent than trivalent dopants within the GGA+U, as expected from previous GGA calculations. Overall, our results suggest that the relatively close agreement sometimes found between properties calculated within the GGA and GGA+U may be misleading, because the underlying electronic behaviors may be profoundly different.",Phase stability of cation-doped LiMnO$_{2}$]{Phase stability of   cation-doped LiMnO$_{2}$ within the GGA+U approximation

Our work is motivated by recent experiments on the high-rate Li-ion battery material LiFePO4; this serves as the basis for our examples, but our analysis and conclusions apply to any intercalation material. We describe two general mechanisms for the suppression of phase separation in nano-particles: (i) a classical bulk effect, predicted by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, in which the diffuse phase boundary becomes confined by the particle geometry; and (ii) a novel surface effect, predicted by chemical-potential-dependent reaction kinetics, in which insertion/extraction reactions stabilize composition gradients near surfaces in equilibrium with the local environment.

37,1,0503109v1,"We present a mechanochemical model for myosin V, a two-headed processive motor protein. We derive the properties of a dimer from those of an individual head, which we model both with a 4-state cycle (detached, attached with ADP.Pi, attached with ADP and attached without nucleotide) and alternatively with a 5-state cycle (where the power stroke is not tightly coupled to the phosphate release). In each state the lever arm leaves the head at a different, but fixed, angle. The lever arm itself is described as an elastic rod. The chemical cycles of both heads are coordinated exclusively by the mechanical connection between the two lever arms. The model explains head coordination by showing that the lead head only binds to actin after the power stroke in the trail head and that it only undergoes its power stroke after the trail head unbinds from actin. Both models (4- and 5-state) reproduce the observed hand-over-hand motion and fit the measured force-velocity relations. The main difference between the two models concerns the load dependence of the run length, which is much weaker in the 5-state model. We show how systematic processivity measurement under varying conditions could be used to distinguish between both models and to determine the kinetic parameters.",Elastic lever arm model for myosin V
37,2,0506024v1,"We model the dynamical states of the C-termini of tubulin dimers that comprise neuronal microtubules. We use molecular dynamics and other computational tools to explore the time-dependent behavior of conformational states of a C-terminus of tubulin within a microtubule and assume that each C-terminus interacts via screened Coulomb forces with the surface of a tubulin dimer, with neighboring C-termini and also with any adjacent microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). Each C-terminus can either bind to the tubulin surface via one of several positively charged regions or can be allowed to explore the space available in the solution surrounding the dimer. We find that the preferential orientation of each C-terminus is away from the tubulin surface but binding to the surface may also take place, albeit at a lower probability. The results of our model suggest that perturbations generated by the C-termini interactions with counter-ions surrounding a MAP2 may propagate over distances greater than those between adjacent microtubules. Thus, the MAP2 structure is able to act as a kind of biological wire (or a cable) transmitting local electrostatic perturbations resulting in ionic concentration gradients from one microtubule to another.

The main improvements in the current experiment are a significant suppression of the surface roughness of the Au layers deposited on the interacting surfaces, and a decrease in the experimental error in the measurement of the absolute separation. A metrological analysis of all data permitted us to determine both the random and systematic errors, and to find the total experimental error as a function of separation at the 95% confidence level. In contrast to all previous experiments on the Casimir effect, our smallest experimental error ($\sim 0.5$%) is achieved over a wide separation range. The theoretical Casimir pressures in the experimental configuration were calculated by the use of four theoretical approaches suggested in the literature. All corrections to the Casimir force were calculated or estimated. All theoretical errors were analyzed and combined to obtain the total theoretical error at the 95% confidence level. Finally, the confidence interval for the differences between theoretical and experimental pressures was obtained as a function of separation. Our measurements are found to be consistent with two theoretical approaches utilizing the plasma model and the surface impedance over the entire measurement region.

Metachronism arises as a local minimum of the beating threshold and leads to a rather constant flow.",Spontaneous creation of macroscopic flow and metachronal waves in an   array of cilia
40,5,0610154v2,"Actuating periodically an elastic filament in a viscous liquid generally breaks the constraints of Purcell's scallop theorem, resulting in the generation of a net propulsive force. This observation suggests a method to design simple swimming devices - which we call ""elastic swimmers"" - where the actuation mechanism is embedded in a solid body and the resulting swimmer is free to move. In this paper, we study theoretically the kinematics of elastic swimming. After discussing the basic physical picture of the phenomenon and the expected scaling relationships, we derive analytically the elastic swimming velocities in the limit of small actuation amplitude. The emphasis is on the coupling between the two unknowns of the problems - namely the shape of the elastic filament and the swimming kinematics - which have to be solved simultaneously. We then compute the performance of the resulting swimming device, and its dependance on geometry. The optimal actuation frequency and body shapes are derived and a discussion of filament shapes and internal torques is presented. Swimming using multiple elastic filaments is discussed, and simple strategies are presented which result in straight swimming trajectories. Finally, we compare the performance of elastic swimming with that of swimming microorganisms.",Floppy swimming: Viscous locomotion of actuated elastica

44,1,0501364v1,"Stripe-like domains of Langmuir monolayers formed by surfactants with partially fluorinated lipid anchors (F-alkyl lipids) are observed at the gas-liquid phase coexistence. The average periodicity of the stripes, measured by fluorescence microscopy, is in the micrometer range, varying between 2 and 8 microns. The observed stripe-like patterns are stabilized due to dipole-dipole interactions between terminal -CF3 groups. These interactions are particularly strong as compared with non-fluorinated lipids due to the low dielectric constant of the surrounding media (air). These long-range dipolar interactions tend to elongate the domains, in contrast to the line tension that tends to minimize the length of the domain boundary. This behavior should be compared with that of the lipid monolayer having alkyl chains, and which form spherical micro-domains (bubbles) at the gas-liquid coexistence. The measured stripe periodicity agrees quantitatively with a theoretical model. Moreover, the reduction in line tension by adding traces (0.1 mol fraction) of cholesterol results, as expected, in a decrease in the domain periodicity.",Stripes of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Chains: Dipolar Langmuir   Monolayers

44,3,0502348v2,"A theoretical approach has been undertaken in order to model the thermodynamic equilibrium of a vesicle adhering to a flat substrate. The vesicle is treated in a canonical description with a fixed number of sites. A finite number of these sites are occupied by mobile ligands that are capable of interacting with a discrete number of receptors immobilized on the substrate. Explicit consideration of the bending energy of the vesicle shape has shown that the problem of the vesicle shape can be decoupled from the determination of the optimum allocation of ligands over the vesicle. The allocation of bound and free ligands in the vesicle could be determined as a function of the size of the contact zone, the ligand-receptor binding strength and the concentration of the system constituents. Several approximate solutions for different regions of system parameters are determined and in particular, the distinction between receptor-dominated equilibria and ligand-dominated equilibria is found to be important. The crossover between these two types of solutions is found to occur at a critical size of the contact zone. The presented approach enables the calculation of the effective adhesion strength of the vesicle and thus permits meaningful comparisons with relevant experiments as well as connecting the presented model with the proven success of the continuum approach for modeling the shapes of adhering vesicles. The behavior of the effective adhesion strength is analyzed in detail and several approximate expressions for it are given.",Effective adhesion strength of specifically bound vesicles

47,2,1702.04517v5,"Convective storm nowcasting has attracted substantial attention in various fields. Existing methods under a deep learning framework rely primarily on radar data. Although they perform nowcast storm advection well, it is still challenging to nowcast storm initiation and growth, due to the limitations of the radar observations. This paper describes the first attempt to nowcast storm initiation, growth, and advection simultaneously under a deep learning framework using multi-source meteorological data. To this end, we present a multi-channel 3D-cube successive convolution network (3D-SCN). As real-time re-analysis meteorological data can now provide valuable atmospheric boundary layer thermal dynamic information, which is essential to predict storm initiation and growth, both raw 3D radar and re-analysis data are used directly without any handcraft feature engineering. These data are formulated as multi-channel 3D cubes, to be fed into our network, which are convolved by cross-channel 3D convolutions. By stacking successive convolutional layers without pooling, we build an end-to-end trainable model for nowcasting.

47,3,1805.09091v1,"Ensemble weather predictions require statistical post-processing of systematic errors to obtain reliable and accurate probabilistic forecasts. Traditionally, this is accomplished with distributional regression models in which the parameters of a predictive distribution are estimated from a training period. We propose a flexible alternative based on neural networks that can incorporate nonlinear relationships between arbitrary predictor variables and forecast distribution parameters that are automatically learned in a data-driven way rather than requiring pre-specified link functions. In a case study of 2-meter temperature forecasts at surface stations in Germany, the neural network approach significantly outperforms benchmark post-processing methods while being computationally more affordable. Key components to this improvement are the use of auxiliary predictor variables and station-specific information with the help of embeddings. Furthermore, the trained neural network can be used to gain insight into the importance of meteorological variables thereby challenging the notion of neural networks as uninterpretable black boxes. Our approach can easily be extended to other statistical post-processing and forecasting problems. We anticipate that recent advances in deep learning combined with the ever-increasing amounts of model and observation data will transform the post-processing of numerical weather forecasts in the coming decade.",Neural networks for post-processing ensemble weather forecasts

New developments in this framework include an offline volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere grid, improvements to the CNN architecture, and the minimization of the loss function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing.

It is wettable by indium and defines the diameter of the bump. The indium is evaporated via a second photolithographic step with larger openings and is reflown afterwards. The height of the balls is defined by the volume of the indium. On the readout chip only one photolithographic step is carried out to deposit the UBM and a thin indium layer for better adhesion. After mating both parts a second reflow is performed for self alignment and obtaining a high mechanical strength.   For the placement of the chips a manual and an automatic machine was constructed. The former is very flexible in handling different chip and module geometries but has a limited throughput while the latter features a much higher grade of automatisation and is therefore much more suited for producing hundreds of modules with a well defined geometry.   The reliability of this process was proven by the successful construction of the PILATUS detector.

From heat capacity measurements we find that the total entropy related to the magnetic transition is in agreement with expectations. However, we find a significant contribution to the magnetic entropy in the range from the ordering temperature T_N to nearly 4T_N.

The nontrivial dependence of the SQUID's susceptibility on external flux makes it possible to continuously tune the induced coupling from antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (FM). In particular, for suitable parameters, the induced FM coupling can be sufficiently large to overcome any possible direct AF inductive coupling between the qubits.   The main features follow from a classical analysis of the multi-qubit potential. A fully quantum treatment yields similar results, but with a modified expression for the SQUID susceptibility.   Since the latter is exact, it can also be used to evaluate the susceptibility--or, equivalently, energy-level curvature--of an isolated rf-SQUID for larger shielding and at degenerate flux bias, i.e., a (bistable) qubit.

It is shown that the asymmetry of the junctions results in the increase of the voltage modulation if the critical current is in excess of some threshold value (about 8 microAmps). Below this value the asymmetry leads to the reduction of the voltage modulation as compared to the symmetric case. The comparison with the experiment shows that the asymmetry can explain a large portion of experimental values of the voltage modulation which lie above the theoretical curve for symmetric DC SQUID.

This relevant property means that the materials have a lateral extension, instead to shrink, when they are stretched. For what concerns the acoustic properties of these structures, they absorb noise and vibrations more efficiently than non-auxetic equivalents. The acoustic and optical dispersions obtained in the case of the auxetic model are compared with the dispersions displayed by a conventional honeycomb network.

Selection occurs via multispecies, stochastic population dynamics with reproduction probabilities that depend nonlinearly on the population densities of all species resident in the community. New species are introduced through mutation. Both models are amenable to exact linear stability analysis, and we compare the analytic results with large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining the population size as a function of an average interspecies interaction strength. Over time, the models self-optimize through mutation and selection to approximately maximize a community fitness function, subject only to constraints internal to the particular model. If the interspecies interactions are randomly distributed on an interval including positive values, the system evolves toward self-sustaining, mutualistic communities. In contrast, for the predator-prey case the matrix of interactions is antisymmetric, and a nonzero population size must be sustained by an external resource. Time series of the diversity and population size for both models show approximate 1/f noise and power-law distributions for the lifetimes of communities and species. For the mutualistic model, these two lifetime distributions have the same exponent, while their exponents are different for the predator-prey model.

In the former case of temporal disorder, via the finite-size scaling analysis the transition is clearly shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. In contrast, the geometric or spatial randomness for the latter case yields a discontinuous phase transition. The mean-field limit of the model is analytically solved and then compared with numerical results.

58,2,0503370v1,"Condensation of microcavity polaritons and the substantial influence of pair-breaking disorder and decoherence leading to a laser regime has been recently considered using two different models: a model for direct two band excitons in a disordered quantum well coupled to light and a model where the cavity mode couples instead to a medium of localised excitons, represented by two-level oscillators in the presence of dephasing processes. Even if complementary from the point of view of assumptions, the models share most of the main conclusions and show similar phase diagrams. The issue whether excitons are propagating or localised seems secondary for the polariton condensation and the way in which pair-breaking disorder and decoherence processes influence the condensation and drive the microcavity into a lasing regime is, within the approximations used in each model, generic.

Kimel {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 435}, 655 (2005)]. In this experiment circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses set up a strong magnetic field along the wave vector of the radiation through the inverse Faraday effect, thereby exciting non-thermally the spin dynamics of dysprosium orthoferrites. A theoretical study is performed by using a model for orthoferrites based on a general form of free energy whose parameters are extracted from experimental measurements. The magnetization dynamics is described by solving coupled sublattice Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations whose damping term is associated with the scattering rate due to magnon-magnon interaction. Due to the inverse Faraday effect and the non-thermal excitation, the effect of the laser is simulated by magnetic field Gaussian pulses with temporal width of the order of hundred femtoseconds. When the field is along the z-axis, a single resonance mode of the magnetization is excited. The amplitude of the magnetization and out-of-phase behavior of the oscillations for fields in z and -z directions are in good agreement with the cited experiment. The analysis of the effect of the temperature shows that magnon-magnon scattering mechanism affects the decay of the oscillations on the picosecond scale. Finally, when the field pulse is along the x-axis, another mode is excited, as observed in experiments. In this case the comparison between theoretical and experimental results shows some discrepancies whose origin is related to the role played by anisotropies in orthoferrites.",Magnetization dynamics in dysprosium orthoferrites via inverse Faraday   effect

Combining the two methods it is possible to identify the microscopic electron spin-flip mechanisms responsible for the ultrafast macroscopic magnetization dynamics of the cobalt film. In particular, we show that electron-magnon excitation does not affect the overall magnetization even though it is an efficient spin-flip channel on the sub-200 fs timescale. Instead we find experimental evidence for the relevance of Elliott-Yafet type spin-flip processes for the ultrafast demagnetization taking place on a time scale of 300 fs.",Spin-flip processes and ultrafast magnetization dynamics in Co -   unifying the microscopic and macroscopic view of femtosecond magnetism

The recorded data display a strong dependency on pump helicity during pump-probe temporal overlap, which is shown to be of non-magnetic origin. By accurately fitting the demagnetization curves we also show that demagnetization time and electron-phonon equilibration time are not affected by pump-helicity. Thereby our results do not support direct transfer of angular momentum between photons and spins to be relevant for the demagnetization process. This suggests, in agreement with the microscopic model that we recently presented, that the source of angular momentum could be phonons or impurities rather than laser photons as required in the microscopic model proposed by Zhang and Huebner.",The influence of photon angular momentum on ultrafast spin dynamics in   Nickel

GaN Quantum Dots (QDs), grown by molecular beam epitaxy in a modified Stranski-Krastanow mode, are studied in terms of strain and local environment, as a function of the AlN cap layer thickness, by means of grazing incidence anomalous diffraction. That is, the X-ray photons energy is tuned across the Ga absorption K-edge which makes diffraction chemically selective. Measurement of \textit{hkl}-scans, close to the AlN (30-30) Bragg reflection, at several energies across the Ga K-edge, allows the extraction of the Ga partial structure factor, from which the in-plane strain of GaN QDs is deduced. From the fixed-Q energy-dependent diffracted intensity spectra, measured for diffraction-selected iso-strain regions corresponding to the average in-plane strain state of the QDs, quantitative information regarding composition and the out-of-plane strain has been obtained. We recover the in-plane and out-of-plane strains in the dots.

The current first-principles calculation for the electronic structures of nm-scale [0001] GaN films show that the internal electric fields and the band tilt of these films are in opposite direction to those predicted by PBFV. Additionally, it is determined that an intrinsic self-regulated charge transfer across the film limits the electrostatic potential difference across the film, which renders the local conduction band energy minimum (at the Ga-terminated surface) approximately equal to the local valence band energy maximum (at the N-terminated surface).

This is of high interest because such injecting bunches can be provided, e.g., by state-of-the-art photo cathode RF guns. Here we point out that when an e-bunch is injected in the wakefield it is important to take into account the ponderomotive scattering of the injecting bunch by the laser pulse in the vacuum region located in front of the plasma. At low energies of the injected bunch this scattering results in a significant drop of the collection efficiency.

61,4,0703047v1,"An electron injector concept for laser-plasma accelerator was developed in ref [1] and [2] ; it relies on the use of counter-propagating ultrashort laser pulses. In [2], the scheme is as follows: the pump laser pulse generates a large amplitude laser wakefield (plasma wave). The counter-propagating injection pulse interferes with the pump laser pulse to generate a beatwave pattern. The ponderomotive force of the beatwave is able to inject plasma electrons into the wakefield. We have studied this injection scheme using 1D Particle in Cell (PIC) simulations. The simulations reveal phenomena and important physical processes that were not taken into account in previous models. In particular, at the collision of the laser pulses, most plasma electrons are trapped in the beatwave pattern and cannot contribute to the collective oscillation supporting the plasma wave. At this point, the fluid approximation fails and the plasma wake is strongly inhibited. Consequently, the injected charge is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to the predictions from previous models.",Plasma wake inhibition at the collision of two laser pulses in an   underdense plasma

The concept is based on a combined high-current lens/target configuration. Current is fed at an electrode located downstream from the beginning of the target where pion capturing is needed. The current is carried by plasma outside the target. A second plasma lens section, with an additional current feed, follows the target. The plasma is immersed in a relatively small solenoidal magnetic field to facilitate its current profile shaping to optimize pion capture. Simulations of the not yet fully optimized configuration yielded a 25% higher neutrino flux at a detector situated at 3 km from the target than the horn system for the entire energy spectrum and a factor of 2.5 higher flux for neutrinos with energy larger than 3 GeV. A major advantage of plasma lenses is in background reduction. In antineutrino operation, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of close to 3 for the whole spectrum, and for energy larger than 3 GeV, neutrino background is reduced by a factor of 3.6. Plasma lenses have additional advantages: larger axial currents, high signal purity: minimal neutrino background in antineutrino runs.

Therefore, the above memristive circuit model, which has learning properties, is useful to better understand the origins of primitive intelligence.",Memristive model of amoeba's learning
66,4,0901.3682v1,"We extend the notion of memristive systems to capacitive and inductive elements, namely capacitors and inductors whose properties depend on the state and history of the system. All these elements show pinched hysteretic loops in the two constitutive variables that define them: current-voltage for the memristor, charge-voltage for the memcapacitor, and current-flux for the meminductor. We argue that these devices are common at the nanoscale where the dynamical properties of electrons and ions are likely to depend on the history of the system, at least within certain time scales. These elements and their combination in circuits open up new functionalities in electronics and they are likely to find applications in neuromorphic devices to simulate learning, adaptive and spontaneous behavior.","Circuit elements with memory: memristors, memcapacitors and meminductors"
66,5,0905.2935v3,"When someone mentions the name of a known person we immediately recall her face and possibly many other traits. This is because we possess the so-called associative memory, that is the ability to correlate different memories to the same fact or event. Associative memory is such a fundamental and encompassing human ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our brain must perform it quite easily. The question is then whether electronic neural networks (electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains) can be built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural networks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses between adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic representation. The reason for this is that a passive circuit element able to reproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember its past dynamical history, store a continuous set of states, and be ""plastic"" according to the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all this can be accomplished by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular, by using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have built a memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative memory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons connected by two memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration opens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural processes using memory devices, an important step forward to reproduce complex learning, adaptive and spontaneous behaviour with electronic neural networks.",Experimental demonstration of associative memory with memristive neural   networks

We extensively test the accuracy of the method for the case of shear-thinning and shear-thickening truncated power-law fluids in the parallel plate geometry, and show that the relative error compared to analytical solutions decays approximately linear with the lattice resolution. Finally, we also tested the method in the reentrant-flow geometry, in which the shear-rate is no-longer a scalar and the presence of two singular points requires high accuracy in order to obtain satisfactory resolution in the local stress near these points. In this geometry, we also found excellent agreement with the solutions obtained by standard finite-element methods, and the agreement improves with higher lattice resolution.",Lattice-Boltzmann Method for Non-Newtonian Fluid Flows
67,2,0507295v1,The problem of energy conservation in the lattice Boltzmann method is solved. A novel model with energy conservation is derived from Boltzmann's kinetic theory. It is demonstrated that the full thermo-hydrodynamics pertinent to the Boltzmann equation is recovered in the domain where variations around the reference temperature are small. Simulation of a Poiseuille micro-flow is performed in a quantitative agreement with exact results for low and moderate Knudsen numbers. The new model extends in a natural way the standard lattice Boltzmann method to a thermodynamically consistent simulation tool for nearly-incompressible flows.,Consistent Lattice Boltzmann Method

In addition to the higher order projection of the equilibrium distribution function and a sufficiently accurate Gauss-Hermite quadrature in the original formulation, a new regularization procedure is introduced in this paper. This procedure ensures a consistent order of accuracy control over the non-equilibrium contributions in the Galerkin sense. Using this formulation, we construct a specific lattice Boltzmann model that accurately incorporates up to the third order hydrodynamic moments. Numerical evidences demonstrate that the extended model overcomes some major defects existed in the conventionally known lattice Boltzmann models, so that fluid flows at finite Knudsen number (Kn) can be more quantitatively simulated.

However, it is acknowledged that the method can demonstrate numerical instabilities, e.g., in the vicinity of shocks. We propose a simple and novel technique to stabilise the lattice-Boltzmann method by monitoring the difference between microscopic and macroscopic entropy. Populations are returned to their equilibrium states if a threshold value is exceeded. We coin the name Ehrenfests' steps for this procedure in homage to the vehicle that we use to introduce the procedure, namely, the Ehrenfests' idea of coarse-graining. The one-dimensional shock tube for a compressible isothermal fluid is a standard benchmark test for hydrodynamic codes. We observe that, of all the LBMs considered in the numerical experiment with the one-dimensional shock tube, only the method which includes Ehrenfests' steps is capable of suppressing spurious post-shock oscillations.",Stabilisation of the lattice-Boltzmann method using the Ehrenfests'   coarse-graining

However, the underlying second order analysis of the equation of motion has long been known to be insufficient to consistently derive the fourth order terms that are necessary to represent an extended interface. These same terms are also responsible for thermodynamic consistency, i.e. to obtain a true equilibrium solution with both a constant chemical potential and a constant pressure.

We then introduce a thermodynamically consistent forcing method.",Thermodynamic consistency of liquid-gas lattice Boltzmann simulations

The method, that combines molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry calculations and statistical mechanical modeling, is demonstrated by calculating the absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the B800-B850 BChls of the LH2 antenna complex from Rs. molischianum at room temperature. The calculated spectra are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental results. The calculations reveal that the broadening of the B800 band is mainly caused by the interactions with the polar protein environment, while the broadening of the B850 band is due to the excitonic interactions. Since it contains no fitting parameters, in principle, the proposed method can be used to predict optical spectra of arbitrary pigment-protein complexes of known structure.",Theoretical prediction of spectral and optical properties of   bacteriochlorophylls in thermally disordered LH2 antenna complexes
68,2,0901.4454v2,"Excitation transfer through interacting systems plays an important role in many areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. The uncontrollable interaction of the transmission network with a noisy environment is usually assumed to deteriorate its transport capacity, especially so when the system is fundamentally quantum mechanical. Here we identify key mechanisms through which noise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid transport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for excitation transfer. We show that these are processes that lead to the inhibition of destructive interference and exploitation of line broadening effects. We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected network by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the invariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian. Finally, we show how these principles can explain the remarkable efficiency and robustness of excitation energy transfer from the light-harvesting chlorosomes to the bacterial reaction center in photosynthetic complexes and present a numerical analysis of excitation transport across the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex together with a brief analysis of its entanglement properties.

The influence of Markovian, as well as spatially and temporally correlated (non-Markovian) noise on the generation of entanglement across distinct chromophores (site entanglement) and different excitonic eigenstates (mode entanglement) is studied for different injection mechanisms, including thermal and coherent laser excitation. Additionally, we study the entangling power of the FMO complex under natural operating conditions. While quantum information processing tends to favor maximal entanglement, near unit EET is achieved as the result of an intricate interplay between coherent and noisy processes where the initial part of the evolution displays intermediate values of both forms of entanglement.",Entanglement and entangling power of the dynamics in light-harvesting   complexes
68,4,1001.5108v1,"Photosynthetic antenna complexes capture and concentrate solar radiation by transferring the excitation to the reaction center which stores energy from the photon in chemical bonds. This process occurs with near-perfect quantum efficiency. Recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have revealed that coherent energy transfer - a wavelike transfer mechanism - occurs in many photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes (1-4). Using the Fenna-Matthews-Olson antenna complex (FMO) as a model system, theoretical studies incorporating both incoherent and coherent transfer as well as thermal dephasing predict that environmentally assisted quantum transfer efficiency peaks near physiological temperature; these studies further show that this process is equivalent to a quantum random walk algorithm (5-8). This theory requires long-lived quantum coherence at room temperature, which never has been observed in FMO. Here we present the first evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO at physiological temperature for at least 300 fs, long enough to perform a rudimentary quantum computational operation. This data proves that the wave-like energy transfer process discovered at 77 K is directly relevant to biological function. Microscopically, we attribute this long coherence lifetime to correlated motions within the protein matrix encapsulating the chromophores, and we find that the degree of protection afforded by the protein appears constant between 77 K and 277 K. The protein shapes the energy landscape and mediates an efficient energy transfer despite thermal fluctuations. The persistence of quantum coherence in a dynamic, disordered system under these conditions suggests a new biomimetic strategy for designing dedicated quantum computational devices that can operate at high temperature.",Long-lived quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes at   physiological temperature

In the framework of quantum open system theory, we represent the excitation transfer as the total leakage of the LH2 system and then calculate the transfer efficiency and average transfer time.

FTIR spectroscopy and surface titration were used, respectively to verify the formation of covalent bonds with the electrodes, and obtain the number of active molecular wires in the device. The electrical transport properties of the SAM devices were studied as a function of (i) r-value, (ii) temperatures, and (iii) different electrodes, via the conductance and differential conductance spectra. The measurements were used to analyze the Me-BDT density of states near the electrode Fermi level, and the properties of the interface barriers. We measured the Me-BDT single molecule resistance at low bias and gold electrodes to be 6x10^9 Ohm. We also determine the energy difference, D between the Me-BDT HOMO level and the gold Fermi level to be about 1.8 eV.

We introduce two new methods borrowed from Surface Science to (i) confirm the connectivity between the benzene-dimethane-thiol molecules with the upper Au electrode, and (ii) count the number of isolated molecular wires in the devices.   The electrical transport properties of the SAM diodes were studied at different temperatures via the conductance and differential conductance spectra. We found that a potential barrier caused by the spatial connectivity gap between the pentanethiol molecules and the upper Au electrode dominates the transport properties of the pure pentanethiol SAM diode (r = 0). The transport properties of molecular diodes with low r-values are dominated by the conductance of the isolated benzene-dimethane-thiol molecules in the device. We found that the temperature dependence of the molecular diodes is much weaker than that of the pure pentanethiol device indicating the importance of the benzene-dimethane-thiol simultaneous bonding to the two Au electrodes that facilitate electrical transport. From the differential conductance spectra we also found that the energy difference, Delta between the Au electrode Fermi-level and the benzene-dimethane-thiol HOMO (or LUMO) level is ~1.5 eV; whereas it is ~2.5 eV for the pentanethiol molecule.

A recently synthesized Borromean Ring complex was used as the active molecular element of the transistor devices. It is well established in Single Molecule Transistors that, for sweeps of source-drain voltage, a region of zero conductance commonly appears - known as a conductance gap - which is centered about V_sd = 0. We have observed differential conductance peaks on opposing sides of these conductance gaps exchange positions as a result of changing gate bias. We associate this property with a change in sign of the majority charge carriers flowing through the molecule.

Aiming at an atomic-scale understanding of this finding, we study the initial oxygen incorporation into the Pd(111) surface using density-functional theory. We find that oxygen incorporation into the sub-surface region starts at essentially the same coverage as formation of the surface oxide. This implies that the role of sub-surface oxygen should be considered as that of a metastable precursor in the oxidation process of the surface. The mechanisms found to play a role towards the ensuing stabilization of an ordered oxidic structure with a mixed on-surface/sub-surface site occupation follow a clear trend over the late 4d transition metal series, as seen by comparing our data to previously published studies concerned with oxide formation at the basal surface of Ru, Rh and Ag.

The top sites are found to be preferred for NH3 adsorption on Ni(111) and Pd(111). The diffusion barrier is calculated to be substantially higher for Pd(111) than for Ni(111).

H is found to occupy the hollow sites for both surfaces. For the reaction on Ni(111), the Ead is found to be 0.23 eV lower than E1, while at the step of Ni(211), E1 and Ead are almost equal to each other.

We further consider the case of global warming, where the mean temperature systematically increases with time.

74,3,0610109v2,"We carry out climate simulations for 1880-2003 with GISS modelE driven by ten measured or estimated climate forcings. An ensemble of climate model runs is carried out for each forcing acting individually and for all forcing mechanisms acting together. We compare side-by-side simulated climate change for each forcing, all forcings, observations, unforced variability among model ensemble members, and, if available, observed variability. Discrepancies between observations and simulations with all forcings are due to model deficiencies, inaccurate or incomplete forcings, and imperfect observations. Although there are notable discrepancies between model and observations, the fidelity is sufficient to encourage use of the model for simulations of future climate change. By using a fixed well-documented model and accurately defining the 1880-2003 forcings, we aim to provide a benchmark against which the effect of improvements in the model, climate forcings, and observations can be tested. Principal model deficiencies include unrealistically weak tropical El Nino-like variability and a poor distribution of sea ice, with too much sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere and too little in the Southern Hemisphere. The greatest uncertainties in the forcings are the temporal and spatial variations of anthropogenic aerosols and their indirect effects on clouds.",Climate simulations for 1880-2003 with GISS modelE
74,4,0704.2782v3,"Unconstrained CO2 emission from fossil fuel burning has been the dominant cause of observed anthropogenic global warming. The amounts of ""proven"" and potential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices. Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without sequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit. It is also important to ""stretch"" conventional oil reserves via energy conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are being developed for the era ""beyond fossil fuels"". We argue that a rising price on carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil resources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.","Implications of ""peak oil"" for atmospheric CO2 and climate"

Realization of how close the planet is to ""tipping points"" with unacceptable consequences, especially ice sheet disintegration with sea level rise out of humanity's control, has a bright side. It implies an imperative: we must find a way to keep the CO2 amount so low that it will also avert other detrimental effects that had begun to seem inevitable, e.g., ocean acidification, loss of most alpine glaciers and thus the water supply for millions of people, and shifting of climatic zones with consequent extermination of species. Here I outline from a scientific perspective actions needed to achieve low limits on CO2 and global warming. These changes are technically feasible and have ancillary benefits.

For this large NOBness the center temperature $T_c$ is more than 5 K larger than the arithmetic mean temperature $T_m$ between top and bottom plate and only weakly depends on Ra. To physically account for the NOB deviations of the Nusselt numbers from its Oberbeck-Boussinesq values, we apply the decomposition of $Nu_{NOB}/Nu_{OB}$ into the product of two effects, namely first the change in the sum of the top and bottom thermal BL thicknesses, and second the shift of the center temperature $T_c$ as compared to $T_m$. While for water the origin of the $Nu$ deviation is totally dominated by the second effect (cf. Ahlers et al., J.

According to Kraichnan's 1962 prediction, the flow boundary layers above the cold and hot plates -in which most of the fluid temperature drop is localized- become unstable for large enough $Ra$ and this instability boosts the heat transport compared to the other turbulent regimes. Using the same convection cell as in the 1997 experiment, we show that the reported heat transport increase is accompanied with enhanced temperature fluctuations of the bottom plate, which was heated at constant power levels. Indeed, for $Ra < 10^{12}$, the bottom plate fluctuations can simply be accounted from those in the bulk of the flow. In particular, they share the same spectral density at low frequencies, as if the bottom plate was following the slow temperature fluctuations of the bulk, modulo a constant temperature drop across the bottom boundary layer. Conversely, to account for the plate's temperature fluctuations at higher $Ra$, we no-longuer can ignore the fluctuations of the temperature drop across the boundary layer. The negative skewness of fluctuations at high $Ra$ supports the picture of a boundary layer instability. These observations provide new evidence that the transition reported in 1997 corresponds to the triggering of the Ultimate Regime of convection.",Evidence of a boundary layer instability at very high Rayleigh number

The obtained results show that these phenomena affect both the magnitude of measured ionization rates and shapes of their dependencies on n. The calculated ionization rates are compared with the results of our earlier measurements of BBR-induced ionization rates of Na nS and nD Rydberg states with n=8-20 at 300 K.

In this way the generalized Lyapunov exponents for diagonal correlators of the wave function, $<\psi^2_{n,\mathbf{m}}>$, can be calculated analytically and exactly. This permits to determine the phase diagram of the system. For all dimensions $D > 2$ one finds intervals in the energy and the disorder where extended and localized states coexist: the metal-insulator transition should thus be interpreted as a first-order transition. The qualitative differences permit to group the systems into two classes: low-dimensional systems ($2\leq D \leq 3$), where localized states are always exponentially localized and high-dimensional systems ($D\geq D_c=4$), where states with non-exponential localization are also formed.

81,4,0504557v3,"Roughly half of numerical investigations of the Anderson transition are based on consideration of an associated quasi-1D system and postulation of one-parameter scaling for the minimal Lyapunov exponent. If this algorithm is taken seriously, it leads to unumbiguous prediction of the 2D phase transition. The transition is of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type and occurs between exponential and power law localization (Pichard and Sarma, 1981). This conclusion does not contradict numerical results if the raw data are considered. As for interpretation of these data in terms of one-parameter scaling, such interpretation is inadmissible: the minimal Lyapunov exponent does not obey any scaling. A scaling relation is valid not for minimal, but for some effective Lyapunov exponent, whose dependence on parameters is determined by scaling itself. If finite-size scaling is based on the effective Lyapunov exponent, existence of the 2D transition becomes not definite, but still rather probable.

Specifically, we obtain the phase diagram of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, whose topological zero modes are determined by the non-Bloch winding number instead of the Bloch-Hamiltonian-based topological number. Our work settles the issue of the breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and introduces the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence.",Edge states and topological invariants of non-Hermitian systems
82,2,1809.03139v3,"Asymmetric coupling amplitudes effectively create an imaginary gauge field, which induces a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. Nonzero imaginary magnetic flux invalidates the bulk-boundary correspondence and leads to a topological phase transition. However, the way of non-Hermiticity appearance may alter the system topology. By alternatively introducing the non-Hermiticity under symmetry to prevent nonzero imaginary magnetic flux, the bulk-boundary correspondence recovers and every bulk state becomes extended; the bulk topology of Bloch Hamiltonian predicts the (non)existence of edge states and topological phase transition. These are elucidated in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where chiral-inversion symmetry ensures the vanishing of imaginary magnetic flux. The average value of Pauli matrices under the eigenstate of chiral-inversion symmetric Bloch Hamiltonian defines a vector field, the vorticity of topological defects in the vector field is a topological invariant. Our findings are applicable in other non-Hermitian systems. We first uncover the roles played by non-Hermitian AB effect and chiral-inversion symmetry for the breakdown and recovery of bulk-boundary correspondence, and develop new insights for understanding non-Hermitian topological phases of matter.",Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in a Non-Hermitian System in One Dimension   with Chiral-Inversion Symmetry
82,3,1811.12059v2,"Non-Hermitian skin-edge states emerge only at one edge in one-dimensional nonreciprocal chains, where all states are localized at the edge irrespective of eigenvalues. The bulk topological number is the winding number associated with the complex energy spectrum, which is well defined for metals. We study non-Hermitian nonreciprocal systems in higher dimensions, and propose to realize them with the use of electric diode circuits. We first investigate one-dimensional interface states between two domains carrying different topological numbers, where all states are localized at the interface. They are a generalization of the skin-edge states. Then we generalize them into higher dimensions. We show that there emerge a rich variety of boundary states and interface states including surface, line and point states in three-dimensional systems. They emerge at boundaries of several domains carrying different topological numbers. The resulting systems are the first-order, second-order and third-order topological metals. Such states may well be observed by measuring the two-point impedance in diode circuits.",Non-Hermitian boundary and interface states in nonreciprocal   higher-order topological metals and electrical circuits
82,4,1812.02186v3,"Topological phases of Hermitian systems are known to exhibit intriguing properties such as the presence of robust boundary states and the famed bulk-boundary correspondence. These features can change drastically for their non-Hermitian generalizations, as exemplified by a general breakdown of bulk-boundary correspondence and a localization of all states at the boundary, termed the non-Hermitian skin effect. In this article, we present a completely analytical unifying framework for studying these systems using generalized transfer matrices -- a real-space approach suitable for systems with periodic as well as open boundary conditions. We show that various qualitative properties of these systems can be easily deduced from the transfer matrix. For instance, the connection between the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and the existence of a non-Hermitian skin effect, previously observed numerically, is traced back to the transfer matrix having a determinant not equal to unity. The vanishing of this determinant signals real-space exceptional points, whose order scales with the system size. We also derive previously proposed topological invariants such as the biorthogonal polarization and the Chern number computed on a complexified Brillouin zone. Finally, we define an invariant for and thereby clarify the meaning of topologically protected boundary modes for non-Hermitian systems.",Non-Hermitian systems and topology: A transfer-matrix perspective

By analyzing the interplay between corner/hinge, edge/surface and bulk degrees of freedom we establish that the non-Hermitian extensions of higher-order topological phases exhibit an even richer phenomenology than their Hermitian counterparts and that this can be understood in a unifying way within our biorthogonal framework.

These critical behaviors describe systems with arbitrary competing interactions. We derive the scaling relations and the critical exponents at the two-loop level for anisotropic and isotropic points of arbitrary higher character. The framework is illustrated for the $N$-vector $\phi^{4}$ model describing a $d$-dimensional system. The anisotropic behaviors are derived in terms of many independent renormalization group transformations, each one characterized by independent correlation lengths. The isotropic behaviors can be understood using only one renormalization group transformation. Feynman diagrams are solved for the anisotropic behaviors using a new dimensional regularization associated to a generalized orthogonal approximation. The isotropic diagrams are treated using this approximation as well as with a new exact technique to compute the integrals. The entire procedure leads to the analytical solution of generic loop order integrals with arbitrary external momenta. The property of universality class reduction is also satisfied when the competing interactions are turned off.

It is shown that unlike for the conventional Hartree--Fock approximation this approach allows for a scale-independent renormalization in the vacuum.

We find that, in the limit of vanishing coupling to a bath, MBL systems come in two varieties, with either discrete or continuous local spectra. Both varieties of MBL systems exhibit a ""soft gap"" at zero frequency in the spatially-averaged spectral functions of local operators, which serves as a diagnostic for localization. We estimate the degree to which coupling to a bath broadens these spectral features, and find that characteristics of incipient localization survive as long as the system-bath coupling is much weaker than the characteristic energy scales of the system.

However, we point out that resonant spots are mobile, unlike in models with strong quenched disorder, and that these mobile spots constitute a possible mechanism for delocalization, albeit possibly only on very long timescales. In some models, this argument for delocalization can be made very explicit in first order of perturbation theory in the hopping.

The results of this theory are corroborated and intuitively explained with a phenomenological effective description of the critical point and of the ""badly conducting"" state found near the critical point on the delocalized side. The theory leads to the following sharp predictions: (i) The delocalized state established near the transition is a Griffiths phase, which exhibits sub-diffusive transport of conserved quantities and sub-ballistic spreading of entanglement. The anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha < 1/2$ vanishes continuously at the critical point. The system does thermalize in this Griffiths phase. (ii) The many-body localization transition is controlled by a new kind of infinite randomness RG fixed point, where the broadly distributed scaling variable is closely related to the eigenstate entanglement entropy. Dynamically, the entanglement grows as $\sim\log t$ at the critical point, as it also does in the localized phase. (iii) In the vicinity of the critical point the ratio of the entanglement entropy to the thermal entropy, and its variance (and in fact all moments) are scaling functions of $L/\xi$, where $L$ is the length of the system and $\xi$ is the correlation length, which has a power-law divergence at the critical point.",Theory of the many-body localization transition in one dimensional   systems

Considering the flame as a surface of discontinuity with arbitrary local burning rate and gas velocity jumps given on it, we show that the front dynamics can be determined without having to solve the flow equations in the bulk. On the basis of the Thomson circulation theorem, an implicit integral representation of the gas velocity downstream is constructed. It is then simplified by a successive stripping of the potential contributions to obtain an explicit expression for the vortex component near the flame front. We prove that the unknown potential component is left bounded and divergence-free by this procedure, and hence can be eliminated using the dispersion relation for its on-shell value (i.e., the value along the flame front). The resulting system of integro-differential equations relates the on-shell fuel velocity and the front position.

In the present model, the spin ice state is first formed at intermediate temperatures, and further entropies are released at lower temperatures as the dodecamer phase emerges. Since the spin symmetry is not broken in the dodecamer phase, there still exists macroscopic degeneracy.

We show that this platform can simultaneously exhibit logic-level restoration, cascadability and input-output isolation---fundamental challenges in optical information processing. We also implement low-level spike-processing tasks that are critical for higher level processing: temporal pattern detection and stable recurrent memory. We study these properties in the context of a fiber laser system, but the addition of graphene leads to a number of advantages which stem from its unique properties, including high absorption and fast carrier relaxation. These could lead to significant speed and efficiency improvements in unconventional laser processing devices, and ongoing research on graphene microfabrication promises compatibility with integrated laser platforms.",Dynamical laser spike processing

An abrupt transition is observed at $0.5 T_{\rm c}$. Above this temperature the number of vortex lines remains constant, as they evolve to their equilibrium positions. Below this temperature the number of vortices increases linearly in time until the vortex density has grown sufficiently for turbulence to switch on.

We argue that such turbulence consists of a {\em polarized} tangle of mutually interacting vortex filaments with quantized vorticity. For this system we predict and describe a bottleneck accumulation of the energy spectrum at the classical-quantum crossover scale $\ell$. Demanding the same energy flux through scales, the value of the energy at the crossover scale should exceed the Kolmogorov-41 spectrum by a large factor $\ln^{10/3} (\ell/a_0)$ ($\ell$ is the mean intervortex distance and $a_0$ is the vortex core radius) for the classical and quantum spectra to be matched in value. One of the important consequences of the bottleneck is that it causes the mean vortex line density to be considerably higher that based on K41 alone, and this should be taken into account in (re)interpretation of new (and old) experiments as well as in further theoretical studies.",Bottleneck crossover between classical and quantum superfluid turbulence

We argue that large-scale and small-scale magnetic fluctuations cannot be effectively separated, and that the conventional alpha-model is, in general, not an adequate description of the large-scale dynamo mechanism.

The existence of the filament dynamos are determined by solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations for 3D flows and the solution is used to determine these bounds. It is shown that in the limit of zero resistivity filamentary dynamos always exists in the isotropic case, however when one takes into account that the Frenet frame does not depend only of the filament length parameter s, (anisotropic case) the existence of the filamentary dynamo structure depends on the curvature in the case of screwed dynamos. Frenet curvature is associated with forld and torsion to twist which allows us to have a sretch, twist, and fold method to build fast filament dynamos. Arnold theorem for the helicity bounds of energy of a divergence-free vector field is satisfied for these streamlines and the constant which depends on the size of the compact domain $M C R^{2}$, where the vector field is defined is determined in terms of the dimensions of the constant cross-section filament.

We then study pairs of vortices and their interactions, illustrating a reduced description in terms of ordinary differential equations for the vortex centers. In the realm of two vortices we also consider the existence of stable dipole clusters for two-component condensates.

95,4,0711.1864v1,"Dynamic micromagnetic simulation studies have been completed to observe the motion of a domain wall in a magnetic nanowire in an effort to increase the field-driven domain wall speed. Previous studies have shown that the wire dimensions place a cap on the maximum speed attainable by a domain wall when driven by a magnetic field placed along the direction of the nanowire. Here we present data showing a significant increase in the maximum speed of a domain wall due to the addition of a magnetic field placed perpendicular to the longitudinal driving field. The results are expressed in terms of the relative alignment of the transverse field direction with respect to the direction of the magnetic moments within the domain wall. In particular, when the transverse field is parallel to the magnetic moments within the domain wall, the velocity of the wall varies linearly with the strength of the transverse field increasing by up to 20%. Further examination of the domain wall structure shows that the length of the domain wall also depends linearly on the strength of the transverse field.

The question on the first or second order nature of the quantum phase transition will be discussed. In the first example, the Ising Kondo lattice of CeRu2Si2, experiments seem to be described with the picture of 4f itinerant electron dominated by their spin fluctuations; the strong feedback, induced in magnetic field, between magnetostriction and switch in the nature of the magnetic interactions illustrates the proximity of a quantum critical field. Comparison is made with CeCu6 or YbRh2Si2 series where the idea of local criticality seems to emerge. Basic arguments are discussed for the breakdown of the idea that Yb heavy fermion systems are the the hole analogue of the cerium ones.

However, since the alignment torques determine how particles align in a trap, they are directly relevant to practical applications. Lysozyme crystals are an ideal model system to study factors determining the orientation of nonspherical birefringent particles in a trap. Both their size and their aspect ratio can be controlled by the growth parameters, and their regular shape makes computational modeling feasible. We show that both external shape and internal birefringence anisotropy contribute to the alignment torque. Three-dimensionally trapped elongated objects either align with their long axis parallel or perpendicular to the beam axis depending on their size. The shape-dependent torque can exceed the torque due to birefringence, and can align negative uniaxial particles with their optic axis parallel to the electric field, allowing an application of optical torque about the beam axis.",Orientation of optically trapped nonspherical birefringent particles
97,3,0603037v2,"We explain and demonstrate a new method of force- and position-calibration for optical tweezers with back-focal-plane photo detection. The method combines power spectral measurements of thermal motion and the response to a sinusoidal motion of a translation stage. It consequently does not use the drag coefficient of the trapped ob ject as an input. Thus, neither the viscosity, nor the size of the trapped ob ject, nor its distance to nearby surfaces need to be known. The method requires only a low level of instrumentation and can be applied in situ in all spatial dimensions. It is both accurate and precise: true values are returned, with small error-bars. We tested this experimentally, near and far from surfaces. Both position- and force-calibration were accurate to within 3%. To calibrate, we moved the sample with a piezo-electric translation stage, but the laser beam could be moved instead, e.g. by acousto-optic deflectors.

This first-principles theory is formulated entirely in terms of experimentally accessible parameters (none adjustable). Careful experimental tests of the MDSA theory, undertaken at two laboratories, with very different setups, are described. A detailed description is given of the procedures employed to measure laser beam waist, local beam power at the transparent microspheres trapped by the tweezers, microsphere radius and the trap transverse stiffness, as a function of radius and height in the (inverted microscope) sample chamber. We find generally very good agreement with MDSA theory predictions, for a wide size range, from the Rayleigh domain to large radii, including the values most often employed in practice, and at different chamber heights, both with objective overfilling and underfilling. The results asymptotically approach geometrical optics in the mean over size intervals, as they should, and this already happens for size parameters not much larger than unity. MDSA predictions for the trapping threshold, position of stiffness peak, stiffness variation with height, multiple equilibrium points and `hopping' effects among them are verified. Remaining discrepancies are ascribed to focus degradation, possibly arising from objective aberrations in the infrared, not yet included in MDSA theory.",Towards absolute calibration of optical tweezers

103,3,0605347v2,"The aim of this work is to investigate to what extent the structural properties of a short-range square-well (SW) fluid of range $\lambda$ at a given packing fraction and reduced temperature can be represented by those of a sticky-hard-sphere (SHS) fluid at the same packing fraction and an effective stickiness parameter $\tau$. Such an equivalence cannot hold for the radial distribution function since this function has a delta singularity at contact in the SHS case, while it has a jump discontinuity at $r=\lambda$ in the SW case. Therefore, the equivalence is explored with the cavity function $y(r)$. Optimization of the agreement between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ to first order in density suggests the choice for $\tau$. We have performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the SW fluid for $\lambda=1.05$, 1.02, and 1.01 at several densities and temperatures $T^*$ such that $\tau=0.13$, 0.2, and 0.5. The resulting cavity functions have been compared with MC data of SHS fluids obtained by Miller and Frenkel [J. Phys: Cond. Matter 16, S4901 (2004)]. Although, at given values of $\eta$ and $\tau$, some local discrepancies between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ exist (especially for $\lambda=1.05$), the SW data converge smoothly toward the SHS values as $\lambda-1$ decreases. The approximate mapping $y_{\sw}\to y_{\shs}$ is exploited to estimate the internal energy and structure factor of the SW fluid from those of the SHS fluid. Taking for $y_{\shs}$ the solution of the Percus--Yevick equation as well as the rational-function approximation, the radial distribution function $g(r)$ of the SW fluid is theoretically estimated and a good agreement with our MC simulations is found. Finally, a similar study is carried out for short-range SW fluid mixtures.",How `sticky' are short-range square-well fluids?
103,4,0608685v1,"We develop an extension of the original Reiss-Frisch-Lebowitz scaled particle theory that can serve as a predictive method for the hard sphere pair correlation function g(r). The reversible cavity creation work is analyzed both for a single spherical cavity of arbitrary size, as well as for a pair of identical such spherical cavities with variable center-to-center separation. These quantities lead directly to prediction of g(r). Smooth connection conditions have been identified between the small-cavity situation where the work can be exactly and completely expressed in terms of g(r), and the large-cavity regime where macroscopic properties become relevant. Closure conditions emerge which produce a nonlinear integral equation that must be satisfied by the pair correlation function. This integral equation has a structure which straightforwardly generates a solution that is a power series in density. The results of this series replicate the exact second and third virial coefficients for the hard sphere system via the contact value of the pair correlation function. The predicted fourth virial coefficient is approximately 0.6 percent lower than the known exact value.

103,5,0609549v2,"The simplest bounded potential is that of penetrable spheres, which takes a positive finite value $\epsilon$ if the two spheres are overlapped, being 0 otherwise. In this paper we derive the cavity function to second order in density and the fourth virial coefficient as functions of $T^*\equiv k_BT/\epsilon$ (where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature) for penetrable sphere fluids. The expressions are exact, except for the function represented by an elementary diagram inside the core, which is approximated by a polynomial form in excellent agreement with accurate results obtained by Monte Carlo integration. Comparison with the hypernetted-chain (HNC) and Percus-Yevick (PY) theories shows that the latter is better than the former for $T^*\lesssim 1$ only. However, even at zero temperature (hard sphere limit), the PY solution is not accurate inside the overlapping region, where no practical cancelation of the neglected diagrams takes place. The exact fourth virial coefficient is positive for $T^*\lesssim 0.73$, reaches a minimum negative value at $T^*\approx 1.1$, and then goes to zero from below as $1/{T^*}^4$ for high temperatures. These features are captured qualitatively, but not quantitatively, by the HNC and PY predictions. In addition, in both theories the compressibility route is the best one for $T^*\lesssim 0.7$, while the virial route is preferable if $T^*\gtrsim 0.7$.",Radial distribution function of penetrable sphere fluids to second order   in density

Clear evidence has been found that the existence of the domain wall influences the spin-wave distribution of the thermal modes. The thermal spin-wave modes are quantized due to the confinement in radial direction. They vanish near the domain wall and a new mode evolves inside this complex domain wall structure.

Quantum cluster methods are well suited to describe the Mott phase. Hence, as a step towards a quantitative theory of the competition between antiferromagnetism (AFM) and d-wave superconductivity (SC) in the cuprates, we use Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory to compute zero temperature properties of the two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The d-wave order parameter is found to scale like the superexchange coupling J for on-site interaction U comparable to or larger than the bandwidth. The order parameter also assumes a dome shape as a function of doping while, by contrast, the gap in the single-particle density of states decreases monotonically with increasing doping. In the presence of a finite second-neighbor hopping t', the zero temperature phase diagram displays the electron-hole asymmetric competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity that is observed experimentally in the cuprates. Adding realistic third-neighbor hopping t'' improves the overall agreement with the experimental phase diagram. Since band parameters can vary depending on the specific cuprate considered, the sensitivity of the theoretical phase diagram to band parameters challenges the commonly held assumption that the doping vs T_{c}/T_{c}^{max} phase diagram of the cuprates is universal.

One of the main purposes of CLIO is to demonstrate thermal-noise suppression by cooling mirrors for a future Japanese project, LCGT (Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational Telescope). The CLIO site is in Kamioka mine, as is LCGT. The progress of CLIO between 2005 and 2007 (room- and cryogenic-temperature experiments) is introduced in this article. In a room-temperature experiment, we made efforts to improve the sensitivity. The current best sensitivity at 300 K is about $6 \times 10^{-21} /\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ around 400 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the strain (not displacement) sensitivity is comparable to that of LIGO, although the baselines of CLIO are 40-times shorter (CLIO: 100m, LIGO: 4km). This is because seismic noise is extremely small in Kamioka mine. We operated the interferometer at room temperature for gravitational wave observations. We obtained 86 hours of data. In the cryogenic experiment, it was confirmed that the mirrors were sufficiently cooled (14 K). However, we found that the radiation shield ducts transferred 300K radiation into the cryostat more effectively than we had expected.

These cavities are based on different optical designs: One design uses wedged input mirrors to create additional optical pick-off ports for deriving control signals. The second design employs input mirrors without wedge and thus offers the possibility to use the etalon effect inside the input mirrors for tuning the finesse of the arm cavities. In this article we introduce a concept of maximized flexibility that combines both of these options, by featuring wedges at the input mirrors and using the etalon effect instead in the end mirrors. We present a design for the arm cavities of Advanced Virgo. We have used numerical simulations to derive requirements for the manufacturing accuracy of an end mirror etalon for Advanced Virgo.

In particular, the thermo-refractive noise in the GEO600 beamsplitter is expected to make a substantial contribution to the interferometer's total noise budget. Here we present a new computation of the GEO600 thermo-refractive noise which takes into account the beam's elliptical profile and, more importantly, the fact that the laser beam induces a standing electromagnetic wave in the beamsplitter. The use of updated parameters results in the overall reduction of the calculated noise amplitude by a factor of about 5 in the low-frequency part of the GEO600 band, compared to the previous estimates. We also find, by contrast with previous calculations, that thermo-refractive fluctuations result in white noise between 600 Hz and 39 MHz, at a level of $8.5\cdot 10^{-24}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Finally, we describe a new type of thermal noise, which we call the thermo-chemical noise. This is caused by a random motion of optically-active chemical impurities or structural defects in the direction along a steep intensity gradient of the standing wave.

112,4,1404.1540v1,"Tensor impedance transmitarrays consist of layers of tensor impedance surfaces, separated by dielectric spacers. Because the surface impedance of each layer is a tensor, an arbitrarily polarized incident field is scattered into its constituent TE and TM components. This gives rise to transmitarrays capable of altering the polarization state of an incident field. Various tensor impedance transmitarray have been proposed in the literature to alter the polarization, however no comprehensive methodology has been proposed to design these structures. In this work we propose a procedure for designing tensor impedance transmitarrays using multi-conductor transmissionline (MTL) theory. We treat the transmitarray by modelling free-space and the dielectric spacers as an MTL supporting TE and TM modes with each tensor impedance surface as a shunt load along the MTL. By using simple MTL concepts we can design a transmitarray to be reflectionless while controlling the transmission through the layers and thus the transmitted polarization state. We demonstrate this procedure for two classes of tensor impedance transmitarrays while also validating the design using full-wave simulation.

Expressing the fields via their plane-wave spectrum and harnessing the slowly-varying envelope approximation we obtain semi-analytical formulae for the scattered fields, and prescribe the surface reactance required for the metasurface implementation. The resultant design procedure indicates that the local impedance equalization induces a Fresnel-like reflection, while local power conservation forms a radiating virtual aperture which follows the total excitation field magnitude. The semi-analytical predictions are verified by finite-element simulations of HMSs designed for different source configurations. Besides serving as a flexible design procedure for HMS radiators, the proposed formulation also provides a robust mechanism to incorporate a variety of source configurations into general HMS models, as well as physical insight on the conditions enabling purely reactive implementation of this novel type of metasurfaces.",Passive Lossless Huygens Metasurfaces for Conversion of Arbitrary Source   Field to Directive Radiation

The phase space filtering algorithm consists of applying a filter to the solution that removes outgoing waves only.   The method presented here is a simplified version of the original phase space filter, originally described in [22] for the Schrodinger equation. We apply this method to anisotropic wave models for which the PML is unstable, namely the Euler equations (linearized about a constant jet flow) and Maxwell's equations in an anisotropic medium. Stability of the phase space filter is proved.",A stable absorbing boundary layer for anisotropic waves

115,3,0901.3715v1,"The analysis of wave propagation problems in linear damped media must take into account both propagation features and attenuation process. To perform accurate numerical investigations by the finite differences or finite element method, one must consider a specific problem known as the numerical dispersion of waves. Numerical dispersion may increase the numerical error during the propagation process as the wave velocity (phase and group) depends on the features of the numerical model. In this paper, the numerical modelling of wave propagation by the finite element method is thus analyzed and dis-cussed for linear constitutive laws. Numerical dispersion is analyzed herein through 1D computations investigating the accuracy of higher order 15-node finite elements towards numerical dispersion.

Strong phonon anomalies are prominent not only below the density-wave transition, but also at high temperatures, suggesting an intricate interplay of phonons with the underlying electronic structure. We further propose the star-of-David and tri-hexagon (inverse star-of-David) configurations for the density-wave order in KV$_3$Sb$_5$.

However, the origin of the CDW and its intricate interplay with topological state has yet to be determined. Here, using hard x-ray scattering, we demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) CDW with 2*2*2 superstructure in (Rb,Cs)V3Sb5. Unexpectedly, we find that the CDW fails to induce acoustic phonon anomalies at the CDW wavevector but yields a novel Raman mode which quickly damps into a broad continuum below the CDW transition temperature.

120,1,1312.6120v3,"Despite the widespread practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos.",Exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of learning in deep linear   neural networks

Thus, a very large fraction of the parameters approach zero and are eventually set to zero by simple thresholding.

We analyze deep neural networks with random initialization, which is known to suffer from a pathologically sharp shape of the landscape when the network becomes sufficiently wide. We reveal that batch normalization in the last layer contributes to drastically decreasing such pathological sharpness if the width and sample number satisfy a specific condition. In contrast, it is hard for batch normalization in the middle hidden layers to alleviate pathological sharpness in many settings. We also found that layer normalization cannot alleviate pathological sharpness either.

We study this phenomenon by analysing the dynamics and the performance of over-parameterised two-layer neural networks in the teacher-student setup, where one network, the student, is trained on data generated by another network, called the teacher. We show how the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is captured by a set of differential equations and prove that this description is asymptotically exact in the limit of large inputs. Using this framework, we calculate the final generalisation error of student networks that have more parameters than their teachers. We find that the final generalisation error of the student increases with network size when training only the first layer, but stays constant or even decreases with size when training both layers. We show that these different behaviours have their root in the different solutions SGD finds for different activation functions.

120,5,2004.01190v3,"A recent line of works studied wide deep neural networks (DNNs) by approximating them as Gaussian Processes (GPs). A DNN trained with gradient flow was shown to map to a GP governed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), whereas earlier works showed that a DNN with an i.i.d. prior over its weights maps to the so-called Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). Here we consider a DNN training protocol, involving noise, weight decay and finite width, whose outcome corresponds to a certain non-Gaussian stochastic process. An analytical framework is then introduced to analyze this non-Gaussian process, whose deviation from a GP is controlled by the finite width. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) In the infinite width limit, we establish a correspondence between DNNs trained with noisy gradients and the NNGP, not the NTK. (ii) We provide a general analytical form for the finite width correction (FWC) for DNNs with arbitrary activation functions and depth and use it to predict the outputs of empirical finite networks with high accuracy. Analyzing the FWC behavior as a function of $n$, the training set size, we find that it is negligible for both the very small $n$ regime, and, surprisingly, for the large $n$ regime (where the GP error scales as $O(1/n)$).

The likelihood fits in either case produce only the fitted quantities but not the goodness of fit. With binned data, one can obtain a measure of the goodness of fit by using the $\chi^2$ method, after the maximum likelihood fitting is performed. With unbinned data, currently, the fitted parameters are obtained but no measure of goodness of fit is available. This remains, to date, an unsolved problem in statistics. By considering the transformation properties of likelihood functions with respect to change of variable, we conclude that the likelihood ratio of the theoretically predicted probability density to that of {\it the data density} is invariant under change of variable and provides the goodness of fit. We show how to apply this likelihood ratio for binned as well as unbinned likelihoods and show that even the $\chi^2$ test is a special case of this general theory. In order to calculate errors in the fitted quantities, we need to solve the problem of inverse probabilities. We use Bayes' theorem to do this, using the data density obtained in the goodness of fit.

Heterogeneity in the degree distribution often reduces the average distance between nodes but, paradoxically, may suppress synchronization in networks of oscillators coupled symmetrically with uniform coupling strength. Here we offer a solution to this apparent paradox. Our analysis is partially based on the identification of a diffusive process underlying the communication between oscillators and reveals a striking relation between this process and the condition for the linear stability of the synchronized states. We show that, for a given degree distribution, the maximum synchronizability is achieved when the network of couplings is weighted and directed, and the overall cost involved in the couplings is minimum. This enhanced synchronizability is solely determined by the mean degree and does not depend on the degree distribution and system size.

We find that the network synchronizability improves when the network becomes disassortative, i.e. when nodes with low degree are more likely to be connected to nodes with higher degree. We consider the case of both weighed and unweighed networks. The analytical results reported in the paper are then confirmed by a set of numerical observations obtained on weighed and unweighed networks of nonlinear R\""ossler oscillators. Using a nonlinear optimization strategy we also show that negative degree correlation is an emerging property of networks when synchronizability is to be optimized.

The presence of the nanodispersed Ag particles leads to a substantial surface enhancement of the Raman signal from ZnO. We find that the elastic modulus of nanocrystalline ZnO shows a non-monotonic dependence on the crystallite size.

135,1,0501049v1,"In models of triggered seismicity and in their inversion with empirical data, the detection threshold m_d is commonly equated to the magnitude m_0 of the smallest triggering earthquake. This unjustified assumption neglects the possibility of shocks below the detection threshold triggering observable events. We introduce a formalism that distinguishes between the detection threshold m_d and the minimum triggering earthquake m_0 < m_d. By considering the branching structure of one complete cascade of triggered events, we derive the apparent branching ratio n_a (which is the apparent fraction of aftershocks in a given catalog) and the apparent background source S_a that are observed when only the structure above the detection threshold m_d is known due to the presence of smaller undetected events that are capable of triggering larger events. If earthquake triggering is controlled in large part by the smallest magnitudes as several recent analyses have shown, this implies that previous estimates of the clustering parameters may significantly underestimate the true values: for instance, an observed fraction of 55% of aftershocks is renormalized into a true value of 75% of triggered events.",Apparent Clustering and Apparent Background Earthquakes Biased by   Undetected Seismicity
135,2,0502028v1,"Networks are paradigms for describing complex biological, social and technological systems. Here I argue that networks provide a coherent framework to construct coarse-grained models for many different physical systems. To elucidate these ideas, I discuss two long-standing problems. The first concerns the structure and dynamics of magnetic fields in the solar corona, as exemplified by sunspots that startled Galileo almost 400 years ago. We discovered that the magnetic structure of the corona embodies a scale free network, with spots at all scales. A network model representing the three-dimensional geometry of magnetic fields, where links rewire and nodes merge when they collide in space, gives quantitative agreement with available data, and suggests new measurements. Seismicity is addressed in terms of relations between events without imposing space-time windows. A metric estimates the correlation between any two earthquakes. Linking strongly correlated pairs, and ignoring pairs with weak correlation organizes the spatio-temporal process into a sparse, directed, weighted network. New scaling laws for seismicity are found. For instance, the aftershock decay rate decreases as 1/t in time up to a correlation time, t[omori]. An estimate from the data gives t[omori] to be about one year for small magnitude 3 earthquakes, about 1400 years for the Landers event, and roughly 26,000 years for the earthquake causing the 2004 Asian tsunami. Our results confirm Kagan's conjecture that aftershocks can rumble on for centuries.",Networks as Renormalized Models for Emergent Behavior in Physical   Systems
135,3,0507082v2,"Extending the central concept of recurrence times for a point process to recurrent events in space-time allows us to characterize seismicity as a record breaking process using only spatiotemporal relations among events. Linking record breaking events with edges between nodes in a graph generates a complex dynamical network isolated from any length, time or magnitude scales set by the observer. For Southern California, the network of recurrences reveals new statistical features of seismicity with robust scaling laws. The rupture length and its scaling with magnitude emerges as a generic measure for distance between recurrent events. Further, the relative separations for subsequent records in space (or time) form a hierarchy with unexpected scaling properties.",Earthquake recurrence as a record breaking process

Here, hierarchical and mixing properties of such a network are studied. The clustering coefficient is found to exhibit asymptotic power-law decay with respect to connectivity, showing hierarchical organization. This structure is supported by not only main shocks but also small shocks, and may have its origin in the combined effect of vertex fitness and deactivation by stress release at faults. The nearest-neighbor average connectivity and the Pearson correlation coefficient are also calculated. It is found that the earthquake network has assortative mixing. This is a main difference of the earthquake network from the Internet with disassortative mixing.

135,5,0602244v5,"We study the dynamics of the Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model of earthquakes, focusing on the behavior of sequences of epicenters regarded as a growing complex network. Besides making a detailed and quantitative study of the effects of the borders (the occurrence of epicenters is dominated by a strong border effect which does not scale with system size), we examine the degree distribution and the degree correlation of the graph. We detect sharp differences between the conservative and nonconservative regimes of the model. Removing border effects, the conservative regime exhibits a Poisson-like degree statistics and is uncorrelated, while the nonconservative has a broad power-law-like distribution of degrees (if the smallest events are ignored), which reproduces the observed behavior of real earthquakes. In this regime the graph has also a unusually strong degree correlation among the vertices with higher degree, which is the result of the existence of temporary attractors for the dynamics: as the system evolves, the epicenters concentrate increasingly on fewer sites, exhibiting strong synchronization, but eventually spread again over the lattice after a series of sufficiently large earthquakes. We propose an analytical description of the dynamics of this growing network, considering a Markov process network with hidden variables, which is able to account for the mentioned properties.",The Network of Epicenters of the Olami-Feder-Christensen Model of   Earthquakes

The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1} is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones, $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory. This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves.

142,1,0910.0213v2,"In this article, a new scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image composition technique is described, which can significantly reduce drift related image corruptions. Drift-distortion commonly causes blur and distortions in the SEM images. Such corruption ordinarily appears when conventional image-acquisition methods, i.e. ""slow scan"" and ""fast scan"", are applied. The damage is often very significant; it may render images unusable for metrology applications, especially, where sub-nanometer accuracy is required. The described correction technique works with a large number of quickly taken frames, which are properly aligned and then composed into a single image. Such image contains much less noise than the individual frames, whilst the blur and deformation is minimized. This technique also provides useful information about changes of the sample position in time, which may be applied to investigate the drift properties of the instrument without a need of additional equipment.",Real-Time Scanning Charged-Particle Microscope Image Composition with   Correction of Drift
142,2,1006.0171v1,"Modeling artificial scanning electron microscope (SEM) and scanning ion microscope images has recently become important. This is because of the need to provide repeatable images with a priori determined parameters. Modeled artificial images are highly useful in the evaluation of new imaging and metrological techniques, like image-sharpness calculation, or drift-corrected image composition (DCIC). Originally, the NIST-developed artificial image generator was designed only to produce the SEM images of gold-on-carbon resolution sample for image-sharpness evaluation. Since then, the new improved version of the software was written in C++ programming language and is in the Public Domain. The current version of the software can generate arbitrary samples, any drift function, and many other features. This work describes scanning in charged-particle microscopes, which is applied both in the artificial image generator and the DCIC technique. As an example, the performance of the DCIC technique is demonstrated.",Advances in Modeling of Scanning Charged-Particle-Microscopy Images

We have also performed exit wave restorations using simulated noisy images and have determined that both the intensities of individual images and the modulus of the restored complex exit wave are most sensitive to bonding effects at a level of 25% for moderately thick samples of 20-25 nm. This relatively large thickness is due to dynamical amplification of bonding contrast arising from partial de-channeling of 1s states.,Optimized conditions for direct imaging of bonding charge density in   electron microscopy
142,4,1108.5350v4,"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful imaging tool that has found broad application in materials science, nanoscience and biology(1-3). With the introduction of aberration-corrected electron lenses, both the spatial resolution and image quality in TEM have been significantly improved(4,5) and resolution below 0.5 {\AA} has been demonstrated(6). To reveal the 3D structure of thin samples, electron tomography is the method of choice(7-11), with resolutions of ~1 nm^3 currently achievable(10,11). Recently, discrete tomography has been used to generate a 3D atomic reconstruction of a silver nanoparticle 2-3 nm in diameter(12), but this statistical method assumes prior knowledge of the particle's lattice structure and requires that the atoms fit rigidly on that lattice. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a general electron tomography method that achieves atomic scale resolution without initial assumptions about the sample structure. By combining a novel projection alignment and tomographic reconstruction method with scanning transmission electron microscopy, we have determined the 3D structure of a ~10 nm gold nanoparticle at 2.4 {\AA} resolution. While we cannot definitively locate all of the atoms inside the nanoparticle, individual atoms are observed in some regions of the particle and several grains are identified at three dimensions. The 3D surface morphology and internal lattice structure revealed are consistent with a distorted icosahedral multiply-twinned particle. We anticipate that this general method can be applied not only to determine the 3D structure of nanomaterials at atomic scale resolution(13-15), but also to improve the spatial resolution and image quality in other tomography fields(7,9,16-20).",Electron tomography at 2.4 Å resolution

Size of peak is determined by point spread (PS) of instruments as well as that of atoms when point resolution reach the subangstrom scale and thus PS of instruments is comparable with that of atoms. In this article, relationship between PS with atomic numbers, sample thickness, and spherical aberration coefficients will be studied in both negative Cs imaging (NCSI) and positive Cs imaging (PCSI) modes by means of dynamical image simulation. Through comparing the peak width with different thickness and different values of spherical aberration, NCSI mode is found to be superior to PCSI considering smaller peak width in the structural image.",Study of point spread in aberration-corrected high-resolution   transmission electron microscopy

However, this global pressure formulation exists only for Total Differential (TD) three-phase data, which depend only on two functions of saturations and global pressure: the global capillary pressure and the global mobility.

In this case, a steady state is possible in which drainage balances the input, and we present analytical expressions for the resulting steady profile and radial extent. We demonstrate good agreement between our experiments, which use a bed of vertically aligned tubes as the porous medium, and the theoretically predicted evolution and steady state. However, analogous experiments using glass beads as the porous medium exhibit a variety of unexpected behaviours, including overshoot of the steady-state radius and subsequent retreat, thus highlighting the importance of the porous medium geometry and permeability structure in these systems.",Axisymmetric viscous gravity currents flowing over a porous medium

143,4,1104.1943v1,"Tortuosity ($T$) is a parameter describing an average elongation of fluid streamlines in a porous medium as compared to free flow. In this paper several methods of calculating this quantity from lengths of individual streamlines are compared and their weak and strong features are discussed. An alternative method is proposed, which enables one to calculate $T$ directly from the fluid velocity field, without the need of determining streamlines, which greatly simplifies determination of tortuosity in complex geometries, including those found in experiments or 3D computer models. Numerical results obtained with this method suggest that (a) the hydraulic tortuosity of an isotropic fibrous medium takes on the form $T = 1 + p\sqrt{1-\phi}$, where $\phi$ is the porosity and $p$ is a constant and (b) the exponent controlling the divergence of $T$ with the system size at percolation threshold is related to an exponent describing the scaling of the most probable traveling length at bond percolation.",Hydraulic tortuosity in arbitrary porous media flow
143,5,1106.2731v1,"We investigate the effect of a temperature gradient on oil recovery in a two-dimensional pore-network model. The oil viscosity depends on temperature as, $\mu_o=exp(B/T)$, where $B$ is a physico-chemical parameter depending on the type of oil, and $T$ is the temperature. A temperature gradient is applied across the medium in the flow direction. Initially, the porous medium is saturated with oil and, then, another fluid is injected. We have considered two cases representing different injection strategies. In the first case, the invading fluid viscosity is constant (finite viscosity ratio) while in the second one, the invading fluid is inviscid (infinite viscosity ratio). Our results show that, for the case of finite viscosity ratio, recovery increases with $\Delta T$ independently on strength or sign of the gradient. For an infinite viscosity ratio, a positive temperature gradient is necessary to enhance recovery. Moreover, we show that, for $\Delta T>0$, the percentage of oil recovery generally decreases (increases) with $B$ for a finite (infinite) viscosity ratio. Finally, we also extend our results for infinite viscosity ratio to a three-dimensional porous media geometry.",Oil displacement through a porous medium with a temperature gradient

Using first-principles calculations within density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic ground states of monolayers of Mn- and Cr-based semiconducting trichalcogenides. We show that the second and third nearest-neighbor exchange interactions ($J_2$ and $J_3$) between magnetic ions, which have been largely overlooked in previous theoretical studies, are crucial in determining the magnetic ground state. Specifically, we find that monolayer $\text{CrSiTe}_3$ is an antiferromagnet with a zigzag spin texture due to significant contribution from $J_3$, whereas $\text{CrGeTe}_3$ is a ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 106 K. Monolayers of Mn-compounds ($\text{MnPS}_3$ and $\text{MnPSe}_3$) always show antiferromagnetic Neel order. We identify the physical origin of various exchange interactions, and demonstrate that strain can be an effective knob for tuning the magnetic properties. Possible magnetic ordering in the bulk is also discussed.

144,3,1507.07275v2,"Two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors are crucial to develop low-dimensional spintronic devices. Using density functional theory, we show that single-layer chromium trihalides (SLCTs) (CrX$_3$,X=F, Cl, Br and I) constitute a series of stable 2D intrinsic FM semiconductors. A free-standing SLCT can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal, due to a low cleavage energy and a high in-plane stiffness. Electronic structure calculations using the HSE06 functional indicate that both bulk and single-layer CrX$_3$ are half semiconductors with indirect gaps and their valence bands and conduction bands are fully spin-polarized in the same spin direction. The energy gaps and absorption edges of CrBr$_3$ and CrI$_3$ are found to be in the visible frequency range, which implies possible opt-electronic applications. Furthermore, SLCTs are found to possess a large magnetic moment of 3$\mu_B$ per formula unit and a sizable magnetic anisotropy energy. The magnetic exchange constants of SLCTs are then extracted using the Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian and the microscopic origins of the various exchange interactions are analyzed. A competition between a near 90$^\circ$ FM superexchange and a direct antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange results in a FM nearest-neighbour exchange interaction. The next and third nearest-neighbour exchange interactions are found to be FM and AFM respectively and this can be understood by the angle-dependent extended Cr-X-X-Cr superexchange interaction. Moreover, the Curie temperatures of SLCTs are also predicted using Monte Carlo simulations and the values can further increase by applying a biaxial tensile strain. The unique combination of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism, half semiconductivity and large magnetic anisotropy energies renders the SLCTs as promising candidates for next-generation semiconductor spintronic applications.",Robust Intrinsic Ferromagnetism and Half Semiconductivity in Stable   Two-Dimensional Single-Layer Chromium Trihalides

The CrSe2 and CrTe2 monolayers without strains are found to be AFM and FM, respectively. Under the biaxial tensile strain, the CrSe2 monolayer tends to be FM when the strain is larger than 2%. The FM state is further stabilized when the strain is increased. Moreover, the CrSe2 monolayer changes to be half-metallic when the tensile strain is larger than 10%. While for the CrTe2 monolayer, the critical strain at which the transition between the FM and AFM states occurs is compressive, of -1%. Relatively small tensile strains of 4% and 2%, respectively, can enhance the Curie temperature of CrSe2 and CrTe2 monolayers above the room temperature. The strain-induced switch between the FM and AFM states in CrSe2 (CrTe2) monolayer can be understood by the competition between the AFM Cr-Cr direct exchange and FM Cr-Se(Te)-Cr superexchange interactions. The tunable and attractive magnetic and electronic properties controlled by the flexible strain are desirable for the future nanoelectronic applications.","Strain-controlled switch between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism   in 1T-CrX2 (X = Se, Te) monolayers"

However, tuning magnetic proper-ties in these materials is yet to be addressed. Here, we found a striped antiferromag-netic (sAFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition undergoing from monolayer to bilayer and thicker CrS2. This transition is attributed to charge sharing of interlayer S atoms and its resulting charge transfer from Cr d eg to t2g orbitals. The transferred charge reduces a portion of Cr4+ to Cr3+, which enhances the double-exchange mechanism favoring FM rather than sAFM ordering. Doping of electrons shares the same effect with stacking induced charge sharing. Therefore, charge doping could either manip-ulate the magnetic ordering between sAFM and FM or tune CrS2 between p- and n-doped magnetic semiconductors.

145,2,0601324v1,"In the current AFM experiments the distribution of unfolding times, P(t), is measured by applying a constant stretching force f_s from which the apparent unfolding rate is obtained. To describe the complexity of the underlying energy landscape requires additional probes that can incorporate the dynamics of tension propagation and relaxation of the polypeptide chain upon force quench. We introduce a theory of force correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to map the parameters of the energy landscape of proteins. In the FCS the joint distribution, P(T,t) of folding and unfolding times is constructed by repeated application of cycles of stretching at constant fs, separated by release periods T during which the force is quenched to f_q<f_s. During the release period, the protein can collapse to a manifold of compact states or refold. We show that P(T,t) can be used to resolve the kinetics of unfolding as well as formation of native contacts and to extract the parameters of the energy landscape using chain extension as the reaction coordinate and P(T,t). We illustrate the utility of the proposed formalism by analyzing simulations of unfolding-refolding trajectories of a coarse-grained protein S1 with beta-sheet architecture for several values of f_s, T and f_q=0. The simulations of stretch-relax trajectories are used to map many of the parameters that characterize the energy landscape of S1.",Mapping the energy landscape of biomolecules using single molecule force   correlation spectroscopy (FCS): Theory and applications

The purpose of the present work is to compare the reliability of the chemically-based Sorenson/Head-Gordon (SHG) model and a standard native centric model in reproducing through molecular dynamics simulations some of the well known features of the folding transition of this small domain. Our results show that the G\={o} model correctly reproduces the cooperative, two-state, folding mechanism of the WW-domain, while the SHG model predicts a transition occurring in two stages: a collapse followed by a structural rearrangement. The lack of a cooperative folding in the SHG simulations appears to be related to the non-funnel shape of the energy landscape featuring a partitioning of the native valley in sub-basins corresponding to different chain chiralities. However the SHG approach remains more reliable in estimating the $\Phi$-values with respect to G\={o}-like description. This may suggest that the WW-domain folding process is stirred by energetic and topological factors as well, and it highlights the better suitability of chemically-based models in simulating mutations.",Testing simplified protein models of the hPin1 WW domain

Here I show that this new type of spectroscopy is described using a phenomenological spin-assisted tunneling Hamiltonian. Within this formalism, the inelastic $dI/dV$ lineshape is related to the spin spectral weight of the probed magnetic atom. This accounts for the spin selection rules observed experimentally.

150,3,1006.5608v1,"A scanning tunneling microscope can probe the inelastic spin excitations of a single magnetic atom in a surface via spin-flip assisted tunneling in which transport electrons exchange spin and energy with the atomic spin. If the inelastic transport time, defined as the average time elapsed between two inelastic spin flip events, is shorter than the atom spin relaxation time, the STM current can drive the spin out of equilibrium. Here we model this process using rate equations and a model Hamiltonian that describes successfully spin flip assisted tunneling experiments, including a single Mn atom, a Mn dimer and Fe Phthalocyanine molecules. When the STM current is not spin polarized, the non-equilibrium spin dynamics of the magnetic atom results in non-monotonic $dI/dV$ curves. In the case of spin polarized STM current, the spin orientation of the magnetic atom can be controlled parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic moment of the tip. Thus, spin polarized STM tips can be used both to probe and to control the magnetic moment of a single atom.",Spin dynamics of current driven single magnetic adatoms and molecules

In Phase I of the experiment eight semi-coaxial and five BEGe type detectors have been deployed. The latter type is used in this field of research for the first time. All detectors are made from material with enriched ^{76}Ge fraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse shape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events. This paper documents the algorithms developed before the data of Phase I were unblinded. The double escape peak (DEP) and Compton edge events of 2.615 MeV \gamma\ rays from ^{208}Tl decays as well as 2\nu\beta\beta\ decays of ^{76}Ge are used as proxies for 0\nu\beta\beta\ decay. For BEGe detectors the chosen selection is based on a single pulse shape parameter. It accepts 0.92$\pm$0.02 of signal-like events while about 80% of the background events at Q_{\beta\beta}=2039 keV are rejected.   For semi-coaxial detectors three analyses are developed. The one based on an artificial neural network is used for the search of 0\nu\beta\beta\ decay. It retains 90% of DEP events and rejects about half of the events around Q_{\beta\beta}. The 2\nu\beta\beta\ events have an efficiency of 0.85\pm0.02 and the one for 0\nu\beta\beta\ decays is estimated to be 0.90^{+0.05}_{-0.09}. A second analysis uses a likelihood approach trained on Compton edge events. The third approach uses two pulse shape parameters. The latter two methods confirm the classification of the neural network since about 90% of the data events rejected by the neural network are also removed by both of them. In general, the selection efficiency extracted from DEP events agrees well with those determined from Compton edge events or from 2\nu\beta\beta\ decays.",Pulse shape discrimination for GERDA Phase I data

Lost longitudinal momentum is replaced using radio frequency (RF) cavities, giving a net transverse emittance reduction. The longer path length in the hydrogen of higher momentum muons decreases longitudinal emittance at the expense of transverse emittance. Thus emittance exchange allows these rings to cool in all six dimensions and not just transversely. Alternatively, if the RF is located after the ring, it may be possible to cool the muons by stopping them as they spiral adiabatically into a central swarm.

When compressed beyond about 2.8 TPa, these exotic low-coordinated phases become competitive with the groundstate and other high-symmetry atomic phases. Using nudged elastic band method, the transition path and the associated energy barrier between these high-pressure phases are evaluated. In particular for the case of dissociation of diatomic molecular phase into the atomic metallic Cs-IV phase, the existent barrier might raise the transition pressure about 200 GPa at low temperatures. Plenty of flat and broad basins on the energy surface of dense hydrogen have been discovered, which should take a major responsibility for the highly anharmonic zero point vibrations of the lattice, as well as the quantum structure fluctuations in some extreme cases. At zero pressure, our analysis demonstrates that all of these atomic phases of dense hydrogen known so far are unquenchable.   NOTE: In the previous version of this paper (1010.3392v1) we made a mistake when evaluating the enthalpy of Cs-IV phase, which misled us to a conclusion that taking the multi-atomic molecular phases as the ground-state. After corrected this error, however, the atomic phase of Cs-IV becomes the static structure with the lowest enthalpy. Current version not only includes a substantial improvement of the previous one, but also contains many NEW interesting topics that were not touched before.",High-pressure behavior of dense hydrogen up to 3.5 TPa from density   functional theory calculations
158,1,0503231v1,"We investigate the gravity driven rapid failure of a granular step composed of non-cohesive steel beads. The step is initially held together with electromagnets, and released when the current is switched off. We visualize the surface and the motion of the grains during the entire relaxation. The initial failure occurs at the surface and the subsequent flow is also confined to the surface as the step relaxes to its final state. The final shape of the surface is almost linear, depends on the initial angle of the step, and is not sensitive to the size of the grains. The average final slope of the pile is only slightly lower than the angle of repose of a pile formed by slowly pouring particles on to a flat surface. The evolution of the step is compared with a proposed convective-diffusion model of our system. The qualitative features of the relaxation are captured by the model after a flow-dependent dissipation parameter is introduced.",Failure of a granular step

We more specifically focus on the role of side walls by carrying out experiments in setup of different widths, from narrow channels 20 particle diameters wide to channels 600 particle diameters wide. Results show that steady flows on pile are entirely controlled by side wall effects. A theoretical model, taking into account the wall friction and based on a simple local constitutive law recently proposed for other granular flow configurations (GDR MiDi 2004), gives predictions in quantitative agreement with the measurements.

Periodic conditions are used to determined the inclination of the free surface. It is shown that no periodic solution can be found in some domain of the bulk- and wall- friction parameters larger than 30 degrees. When a stable periodic solution exists, we show that the finite amplitude of motion leads to generate a flow localised (i) at the free surface, (ii) near the bulldozer wall and (iii) in the yield band; this may enforce a bulk convection too. At last, we argue why bulk convection is generated when the periodic solution is not stable. Results are compared to experimental data.

Analysis of these data and their inter-relations suggest the local inertial number - defined as the ratio between local inertial forces and local confinement forces - to be the relevant dimensionless parameter to describe the transition from the quasi-static part of the packing to the flowing part at the surface of the heap. Variations of the components of the stress tensor as well as the ones of rms velocity as a function of the inertial number are analysed within both the quasi-static and the flowing phases.

158,5,0510524v1,"Slow and dense granular flows often exhibit narrow shear bands, making them ill-suited for a continuum description. However, smooth granular flows have been shown to occur in specific geometries such as linear shear in the absence of gravity, slow inclined plane flows and, recently, flows in split-bottom Couette geometries. The wide shear regions in these systems should be amenable to a continuum description, and the theoretical challenge lies in finding constitutive relations between the internal stresses and the flow field. We propose a set of testable constitutive assumptions, including rate-independence, and investigate the additional restrictions on the constitutive relations imposed by the flow geometries. The wide shear layers in the highly symmetric linear shear and inclined plane flows are consistent with the simple constitutive assumption that, in analogy with solid friction, the effective-friction coefficient (ratio between shear and normal stresses) is a constant. However, this standard picture of granular flows is shown to be inconsistent with flows in the less symmetric split-bottom geometry - here the effective friction coefficient must vary throughout the shear zone, or else the shear zone localizes. We suggest that a subtle dependence of the effective-friction coefficient on the orientation of the sliding layers with respect to the bulk force is crucial for the understanding of slow granular flows.",Continuum approach to wide shear zones in quasi-static granular matter

Based on the first-principles calculations, we find that Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ states contribute the largest Fermi surface. $Ln~5d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states form an electron pocket at $\Gamma$, while $5d_{xy}$ states form a relatively bigger electron pocket at A. These Fermi surfaces and symmetry characteristics can be reproduced by our two-band model, which consists of two elementary band representations: $B_{1g}@1a~\oplus~A_{1g}@1b$. We find that there is a band inversion near A, giving rise to a pair of Dirac points along A--M below the Fermi level once including spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we have performed the LDA+Gutzwiller calculations to treat the strong correlation effect of Ni 3d orbitals. In particular, the bandwidth of $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ has been renormalized largely. After the renormalization of the correlated bands, the Ni $3d_{xy}$ states and the Dirac points become very close to the Fermi level. Thus, a hole pocket at A could be introduced by hole doping, which may be related to the observed sign change of Hall coefficient. By introducing an additional Ni $3d_{xy}$ orbital, the hole-pocket band and the band inversion can be captured in our modified model. Besides, the nontrivial band topology in the ferromagnetic two-layer compound La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ is discussed and the band inversion is associated with Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ and La $5d_{xy}$ orbitals.",Electronic structures and topological properties in nickelates   $Ln_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$

The effective correlation strength of the Ni-derived $d$-band crossing the Fermi level in NdNiO$_2$ is found to be greater than that of the Cu-derived $d$-band in CaCuO$_2$, but the predicted magnetic transition temperature of NdNiO$_2$ is substantially lower than that of CaCuO$_2$ because of the smaller bandwidth.",Many-body Electronic Structure of NdNiO$_2$ and CaCuO$_2$

Additionally, we show that the spacing between Efimov features for the relatively small scattering lengths accessible experimentally fail to precisely follow the geometric progression expected for Efimov physics.

A hitherto unanalyzed feature in the 2006 Innsbruck experiment supports this universal prediction, and it provides the first known evidence to date that a direct four-body recombination process plays a role.

As the first example we discuss the 4d10 Giant resonance in Xe@C60 whereas as the second serves the Giant autoionization resonance in Eu@C60. The qualitative difference comes from the fact that photoelectrons from the 4d Giant resonance has small energies (tens of eV) and are strongly reflected by the C60 fullerenes shell. As to the Eu@C60, Giant autoionization leads to fast photoelectrons (about hundred eV) that go out almost untouched by the C60 shell. As a result of the outgoing electrons energy difference the atomic Giant resonances will be largely destroyed in A@C60 while the Giant autoionization resonance will be almost completely preserved. Thus, on the way from Xe@C60 Giant resonance to Eu@C60 Giant autoionization resonance the oscillation structure should disappear. Similar will be the decrease of oscillations on the way from pure Giant to pure Giant autoionization resonances for the angular anisotropy parameters.

164,5,1411.0601v1,"We have measured the spin torques of beta-Tantalum / Co20Fe60B20 bilayers versus Ta thickness at room temperature using an FMR technique. The spin Hall coefficient was calculated both from the observed change in damping coefficient of the ferromagnet with Ta thickness, and from the ratio of the symmetric and anti-symmetric components of the FMR signal. Results from these two methods yielded values for the spin Hall coefficient of -0.090+/-0.005 and -0.11+/-0.01, respectively. We have also identified a significant out-of-plane spin torque originating from Ta, which is constant with Ta thickness. We ascribe this to an interface spin orbit coupling, or Rashba effect, due to the strength and constancy of the torque with Ta thickness. From fitting measured data to a model including interface spin orbit coupling, we have determined the spin diffusion length for beta-Tantalum to be ~2.5 nm.",Experimental Demonstration of the Co-existence of the Spin Hall and   Rashba Effects in beta-Tantalum/Ferromagnet Bilayers

In the present work, NMOR using frequency-modulated light (FM NMOR) is studied in the regime where the longitudinal magnetic field is in the geophysical range ($\sim 500 {\rm mG}$), of particular interest for many applications. In this regime a splitting of the FM NMOR resonance due to the nonlinear Zeeman effect is observed. At sufficiently high light intensities, there is also a splitting of the FM NMOR resonances due to ac Stark shifts induced by the optical field, as well as evidence of alignment-to-orientation conversion type processes. The consequences of these effects for FM-NMOR-based atomic magnetometry in the geophysical field range are considered.",Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with frequency-modulated light in the   geophysical field range

For magnetic fields directed along the light propagation direction, resonances in NMOR appear when linearly polarized light is frequency- or amplitude-modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. Because the frequency of these resonances depends on the magnitude but not the direction of the field, they are useful for scalar magnetometry. New NMOR resonances at the Larmor frequency appear when the magnetic field is tilted away from the light propagation direction in the plane defined by the light propagation and polarization vectors. These new resonances, studied both experimentally and with a density matrix calculation in the present work, offer a convenient method for NMOR-based vector magnetometry.",Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with modulated light in tilted   magnetic fields

Then, we present an efficient method to predict the optimum operating point of the magnetometer, i.e., the light power and rf Rabi frequency providing maximum magnetometric sensitivity. Finally, we apply the method to investigate the evolution of the optimum operating point with temperature. The method is very efficient to determine relaxation rates and thus allowed us to determine the three collisional disalignment cross sections for the components of the alignment tensor.

A theoretical optimization of the magnetometer indicates sensitivities on the order of $2 {\rm pG/\sqrt{Hz}}$ should be achievable in a $1 {\rm cm^3}$ volume.

However, under the irradiation of a microwave capable of producing magnetoresistance oscillation, the distribution function of the high-mobility electron gas deviates remarkably from $f^0$ at low temperatures. Estimating $\tau_{in}$ using an approximate nonequilibrium distribution function rather than using $f^0$, one will find the system to be in the opposite limit $1/\tau_{in}\ll 1/\tau_{q}$ even for T=0 K.

The electron temperature characterizing the system heating due to irradiation, is derived by balancing the energy absorption from the radiation field and the energy dissipation to the lattice through realistic electron-phonon couplings, exhibiting resonant oscillation.

However, in realistic experimental conditions, multiple bands of the wires are occupied and the Majorana end states are accompanied by other fermionic end states. This raises the question concerning the robustness of fractional Josephson effect in these situations. In this work, we show that the absence of the avoided energy crossing which gives rise to the fractional Josephson effect is robust, even when the Majorana fermions are coupled with arbitrary strengths to other fermions. Moreover, we calculate the temperature dependence of the fractional Josephson current and show that it is suppressed by thermal excitations to the other fermion bound states.",Robustness of Majorana Fermion induced Fractional Josephson Effect

Ideally, these junctions are predicted to have an unconventional $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and thus only Shapiro steps at even multiples of the driving frequency. Taking additionally into account overlap between the Majorana fermions, due to the finite length of the wire, renders the Josephson junction conventional for any dc-experiments. We show that probing the current-phase relation in a current biased setup dynamically decouples the Majorana fermions. We find that besides the even integer Shapiro steps there are additional steps at odd and fractional values. However, different from the voltage biased case, the even steps dominate for a wide range of parameters even in the case of multiple modes thus giving a clear experimental signature of the presence of Majorana fermions.",Dynamical detection of Majorana fermions in current-biased nanowires

It has been proposed that the observation of a half-frequency or a fractional Josephson effect is a more reliable test for topological superconductivity than the search for end zero modes. Low-energy end modes can occur accidentally due to impurities. In fact, the fractional Josephson effect has been observed for the semiconductor nanowire system. Here we consider the ac Josephson effect in a conventional s-wave superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junction at a finite voltage. Using a Floquet-Keldysh treatment of the finite voltage junction, we show that the power dissipated from the junction, which measures the ac Josephson effect, can show a peak at half (or even incommensurate fractions) of the Josephson frequency. A similar conclusion is shown to hold for the Shapiro step measurement. The ac fractional Josephson peak can also be understood simply in terms of Landau-Zener processes associated with the Andreev bound state spectrum of the junction.",On the possibility of the fractional ac Josephson effect in   non-topological conventional superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions
167,5,1210.3237v2,"We investigate Josephson currents in mesoscopic rings with a weak link which are in or near a topological superconducting phase. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the Kitaev model of a spinless p-wave superconductor in one dimension, emphasizing how this model emerges from more realistic settings based on semiconductor nanowires. We show that the flux periodicity of the Josephson current provides signatures of the topological phase transition and the emergence of Majorana fermions situated on both sides of the weak link even when fermion parity is not a good quantum number. In large rings, the Majorana fermions hybridize only across the weak link. In this case, the Josephson current is h/e periodic in the flux threading the loop when fermion parity is a good quantum number but reverts to the more conventional h/2e periodicity in the presence of fermion-parity changing relaxation processes. In mesoscopic rings, the Majorana fermions also hybridize through their overlap in the interior of the superconducting ring. We find that in the topological superconducting phase, this gives rise to an h/e-periodic contribution even when fermion parity is not conserved and that this contribution exhibits a peak near the topological phase transition. This signature of the topological phase transition is robust to the effects of disorder. As a byproduct, we find that close to the topological phase transition, disorder drives the system deeper into the topological phase. This is in stark contrast to the known behavior far from the phase transition, where disorder tends to suppress the topological phase.",Signatures of topological phase transitions in mesoscopic   superconducting rings

We combine reported CAI modal abundances and our own set, and present a complete list of CAI modal abundances in carbonaceous chondrites. This includes (in area%): CV: 2.98, CM: 1.21, Acfer 094: 1.12, CO: 0.99, CK/CV (Ningqiang & DaG 055): 0.77, CK: 0.2, CR: 0.12 and CB: 0.1. CAIs are Poisson distributed and if only small areas (<1000 mm2) are studied, the data are probably not representative of the true CAI modal abundances, explaining their reported large scatter in a single chondrite group. Carbonaceous chondrites have excess bulk Al concentrations when compared to the CI-chondritic value. We find a correlation between this excess and CAI modal abundances and conclude that the excess Al was delivered by CAIs. The excess Al is only a minor fraction (usually ~10 rel%, but 25 rel% in case of CVs) of the bulk chondrite Al and cannot have contributed much 26Al to heat the chondrite parent body. Ordinary, enstatite, R- and K-chondrites have an Al deficit relative to CI chondrites and only very low CAI modal abundances, if any are present at all. Carbonaceous chondrites also had an initial Al deficit if the contribution of Al delivered by CAIs is subtracted. Therefore all chondrites probably lost a refractory rich high-T component. Only minor amounts of CAIs are present in the matrix or have been present in the chondrule precursor aggregates.

168,2,1110.3414v1,"Bottke et al. (2007) linked the catastrophic formation of Baptistina Asteroid Family (BAF) to the K/T impact event. This linkage was based on dynamical and compositional evidence, which suggested the impactor had a composition similar to CM2 carbonaceous chondrites. However, our recent study (Reddy et al. 2009) suggests that the composition of (298) Baptistina is similar to LL-type ordinary chondrites rather than CM2 carbonaceous chondrites. This rules out any possibility of it being related to the source of the K/T impactor, if the impactor was of CM-type composition. Mineralogical study of asteroids in the vicinity of BAF has revealed a plethora of compositional types suggesting a complex formation and evolution environment. A detailed compositional analysis of 16 asteroids suggests several distinct surface assemblages including ordinary chondrites (Gaffey SIV subtype), primitive achondrites (Gaffey SIII subtype), basaltic achondrites (Gaffey SVII subtype and V-type), and a carbonaceous chondrite. Based on our mineralogical analysis we conclude that (298) Baptistina is similar to ordinary chondrites (LL-type) based on olivine and pyroxene mineralogy and moderate albedo. S-type and V-type in and around the vicinity of BAF we characterized show mineralogical affinity to (8) Flora and (4) Vesta and could be part of their families. Smaller BAF asteroids with lower SNR spectra showing only a 'single' band are compositionally similar to (298) Baptistina and L/LL chondrites.

168,3,1208.2833v1,"NASA's Dawn spacecraft observations of asteroid (4) Vesta reveal a surface with the highest albedo and color variation of any asteroid we have observed so far. Terrains rich in low albedo dark material (DM) have been identified using Dawn Framing Camera (FC) 0.75 {\mu}m filter images in several geologic settings: associated with impact craters (in the ejecta blanket material and/or on the crater walls and rims); as flow-like deposits or rays commonly associated with topographic highs; and as dark spots (likely secondary impacts) nearby impact craters. This DM could be a relic of ancient volcanic activity or exogenic in origin. We report that the majority of the spectra of DM are similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites mixed with materials indigenous to Vesta. Using high-resolution seven color images we compared DM color properties (albedo, band depth) with laboratory measurements of possible analog materials. Band depth and albedo of DM are identical to those of carbonaceous chondrite xenolith-rich howardite Mt. Pratt (PRA) 04401. Laboratory mixtures of Murchison CM2 carbonaceous chondrite and basaltic eucrite Millbillillie also show band depth and albedo affinity to DM. Modeling of carbonaceous chondrite abundance in DM (1-6 vol%) is consistent with howardite meteorites. We find no evidence for large-scale volcanism (exposed dikes/pyroclastic falls) as the source of DM. Our modeling efforts using impact crater scaling laws and numerical models of ejecta reaccretion suggest the delivery and emplacement of this DM on Vesta during the formation of the ~400 km Veneneia basin by a low-velocity (<2 km/sec) carbonaceous impactor.

This asteroid is especially interesting because it is a potential target for two sample return mission proposals (Marco Polo-R and Hayabusa-2) and human exploration due to its low delta-v for rendezvous. The spectrum of 2008 EV5 is essentially featureless with exception of a weak 0.48-microns spin-forbidden Fe3+ absorption band. The spectrum also has an overall blue slope. The albedo of 2008 EV5 remains uncertain with a lower limit at 0.05 and a higher end at 0.20 based on thermal modeling. The Busch et al.

The best spectral match is with CI carbonaceous chondrites similar to Orgueil, which also have a weak 0.48-microns feature and an overall blue slope.

169,2,0906.2912v1,"Implicit particle-in-cell codes offer advantages over their explicit counterparts in that they suffer weaker stability constraints on the need to resolve the higher frequency modes of the system. This feature may prove particularly valuable for modeling the interaction of high-intensity laser pulses with overcritical plasmas, in the case where the electrostatic modes in the denser regions are of negligible influence on the physical processes under study. To this goal, we have developed the new two-dimensional electromagnetic code ELIXIRS (standing for ELectromagnetic Implicit X-dimensional Iterative Relativistic Solver) based on the relativistic extension of the so-called Direct Implicit Method [D. Hewett and A. B. Langdon, J. Comp. Phys. \textbf{72}, 121(1987)]. Dissipation-free propagation of light waves into vacuum is achieved by an adjustable-damping electromagnetic solver. In the high-density case where the Debye length is not resolved, satisfactory energy conservation is ensured by the use of high-order weight factors. In this paper, we first present an original derivation of the electromagnetic direct implicit method within a Newton iterative scheme. Its linear properties are then investigated through numerically solving the relation dispersions obtained for both light and plasma waves, accounting for finite space and time steps. Finally, our code is successfully benchmarked against explicit particle-in-cell simulations for two kinds of physical problems: plasma expansion into vacuum and relativistic laser-plasma interaction. In both cases, we will demonstrate the robustness of the implicit solver for crude discretizations, as well as the gains in efficiency which can be realized over standard explicit simulations.","Particle-in-cell modelling of relativistic laser-plasma interaction with   the adjustable damping, direct implicit method"
169,3,1012.2494v2,"The Vlasov-Poisson equations describe the evolution of a collisionless plasma, represented through a probability density function (PDF) that self-interacts via an electrostatic force. One of the main difficulties in numerically solving this system is the severe time-step restriction that arises from parts of the PDF associated with moderate-to-large velocities. The dominant approach in the plasma physics community for removing these time-step restrictions is the so-called particle-in-cell (PIC) method, which discretizes the distribution function into a set of macro-particles, while the electric field is represented on a mesh. Several alternatives to this approach exist, including fully Lagrangian, fully Eulerian, and so-called semi-Lagrangian methods. The focus of this work is the semi-Lagrangian approach, which begins with a grid-based Eulerian representation of both the PDF and the electric field, then evolves the PDF via Lagrangian dynamics, and finally projects this evolved field back onto the original Eulerian mesh. In particular, we develop in this work a method that discretizes the 1+1 Vlasov-Poisson system via a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method in phase space, and an operator split, semi-Lagrangian method in time. Second-order accuracy in time is relatively easy to achieve via Strang operator splitting. With additional work, using higher-order splitting and a higher-order method of characteristics, we also demonstrate how to push this scheme to fourth-order accuracy in time. We show how to resolve all of the Lagrangian dynamics in such a way that mass is exactly conserved, positivity is maintained, and high-order accuracy is achieved. The Poisson equation is solved to high-order via the smallest stencil local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) approach.

169,4,1101.3701v1,"This paper discusses a novel fully implicit formulation for a 1D electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulation approach. Unlike earlier implicit electrostatic PIC approaches (which are based on a linearized Vlasov-Poisson formulation), ours is based on a nonlinearly converged Vlasov-Amp\`ere (VA) model. By iterating particles and fields to a tight nonlinear convergence tolerance, the approach features superior stability and accuracy properties, avoiding most of the accuracy pitfalls in earlier implicit PIC implementations. In particular, the formulation is stable against temporal (CFL) and spatial (aliasing) instabilities. It is charge- and energy-conserving to numerical roundoff for arbitrary implicit time steps. While momentum is not exactly conserved, errors are kept small by an adaptive particle sub-stepping orbit integrator, which is instrumental to prevent particle tunneling. The VA model is orbit-averaged along particle orbits to enforce an energy conservation theorem with particle sub-stepping. As a result, very large time steps, constrained only by the dynamical time scale of interest, are possible without accuracy loss. Algorithmically, the approach features a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov solver. A main development in this study is the nonlinear elimination of the new-time particle variables (positions and velocities). Such nonlinear elimination, which we term particle enslavement, results in a nonlinear formulation with memory requirements comparable to those of a fluid computation, and affords us substantial freedom in regards to the particle orbit integrator. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the advertised properties of the scheme. In particular, long-time ion acoustic wave simulations show that numerical accuracy does not degrade even with very large implicit time steps, and that significant CPU gains are possible.","An Energy- and Charge-conserving, Implicit, Electrostatic   Particle-in-Cell Algorithm"

It is shown that if the extra dimensions are larger than 100 fm in size, then this model of consciousness is unphysical. If the dimensions are on the order of 10 fm in size, then a significantly smaller number of microtubulin than originally predicted are required to satisfy experimental constraints.

In order to achieve this polarization directly, it was necessary to irradiate the sample with microwaves for 1500 s. Cooling of the dipolar reservoir occurs during polarization transport through the magnetic field gradient around the paramagnetic impurity, and is rapidly communicated to the bulk by dipolar spin diffusion. As dipolar spin diffusion is significantly faster than Zeeman spin diffusion, the bulk dipolar reservoir cools faster than the Zeeman reservoir.

177,4,0906.3062v3,"In this paper an approach is proposed to represent a class of dissipative mechanical systems by corresponding infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. This approach is based upon the following structure: for any non-conservative classical mechanical system and arbitrary initial conditions, there exists a conservative system; both systems share one and only one common phase curve; and, the value of the Hamiltonian of the conservative system is, up to an additive constant, equal to the total energy of the non-conservative system on the aforementioned phase curve, the constant depending on the initial conditions. We describe in detail this relationship calling the conservative system ``substitute`` conservative system. By considering the dissipative mechanical system as a special fluid in a domain $D$ of the phase space, viz. a collection of particles in this domain, we are prompted to develop this system as an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system of an ideal fluid. By comparing the description of the ideal fluid in Lagrangian coordinates, we can consider the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian as the respective integrals of the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian of the substitute conservative system over the initial value space and define a new Poisson bracket to express the equations of motion in Hamiltonian form. The advantage of the approach is that the value of the canonical momentum density $\pi$ is identical with that of the mechanical momentum $m\dot{q}$ and the value of canonical coordinate $q$ is identical with that of the coordinate of the dissipative mechanical system.

178,1,0508031v3,"The problem of the self-interaction of a quasi-rigid classical particle with an arbitrary spherically symmetric charge distribution is completely solved up to the first order in the acceleration. No ad hoc assumptions are made. It is shown that most of the puzzles that this problem has aroused are due to the inertia of the negative pressure that equilibrates the electrostatic repulsion inside the particle. When the inertia of pressure is taken into account the dressed mass turns out to be the bare mass plus the electrostatic mass m=m_0 + m_e. It is shown that a proper mechanical behaviour requires that m_0 > m_e/3. This condition poses a lower bound on the radius that a particle of a given bare mass and charge may have. The violation of this condition is the reason why the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac formula for the radiation reaction of a point charge predicts unphysical motions that run away or violate causality. Provided the mass condition is met the solutions of the exact equation of motion never run away and conform to causality and energy and momentum conservation. When the radius is much smaller than the wave-length of the radiated fields, but the mass condition is still met, the exact expression reduces to the formula that was advocated recently by Rohrlich.",Radiation reaction of a classical quasi-rigid extended particle

178,3,0512218v2,"This article offers a new approach for analysing the dynamic behaviour of distributions of charged particles in an electromagnetic field. After discussing the limitations inherent in the Lorentz-Dirac equation for a single point particle a simple model is proposed for a charged continuum interacting self-consistently with the Maxwell field in vacuo. The model is developed using intrinsic tensor field theory and exploits to the full the symmetry and light-cone structure of Minkowski spacetime. This permits the construction of a regular stress-energy tensor whose vanishing divergence determines a system of non-linear partial differential equations for the velocity and self-fields of accelerated charge. Within this covariant framework a particular perturbation scheme is motivated by an exact class of solutions to this system describing the evolution of a charged fluid under the combined effects of both self and external electromagnetic fields. The scheme yields an asymptotic approximation in terms of inhomogeneous linear equations for the self-consistent Maxwell field, charge current and time-like velocity field of the charged fluid and is defined as an ultra-relativistic configuration. To facilitate comparisons with existing accounts of beam dynamics an appendix translates the tensor formulation of the perturbation scheme into the language involving electric and magnetic fields observed in a laboratory (inertial) frame.",Asymptotic analysis of ultra-relativistic charge

Similarly, the field strength includes an additional delta-like contribution which is necessary for obtaining this result.

179,4,1006.0047v3,"Ryu and Takayanagi conjectured a formula for the entanglement (von Neumann) entropy of an arbitrary spatial region in an arbitrary holographic field theory. The von Neumann entropy is a special case of a more general class of entropies called Renyi entropies. Using Euclidean gravity, Fursaev computed the entanglement Renyi entropies (EREs) of an arbitrary spatial region in an arbitrary holographic field theory, and thereby derived the RT formula. We point out, however, that his EREs are incorrect, since his putative saddle points do not in fact solve the Einstein equation. We remedy this situation in the case of two-dimensional CFTs, considering regions consisting of one or two intervals. For a single interval, the EREs are known for a general CFT; we reproduce them using gravity. For two intervals, the RT formula predicts a phase transition in the entanglement entropy as a function of their separation, and that the mutual information between the intervals vanishes for separations larger than the phase transition point. By computing EREs using gravity and CFT techniques, we find evidence supporting both predictions.

180,2,1102.0602v1,"Terahertz (THz) waves have been significantly developed in the last fifteen years because of their great potential for applications in industrial and scientific communities1,2. The unique properties of THz waves as transparency for numerous materials and strong absorption for water-based materials are expected to broadly impact biosensing3 such as medical imaging4, chemical identifications5, and DNA recognition6. In particular, for accessing information within a scale comparable to the cell size where interactions between cell membrane and other organelle structures occur, micron size spatial resolution is required. Due to the large wavelength, however, the joint capability of THz near-field imaging with real-time acquisition, which is a highly desirable ability for observing real-time changes of in vivo sample, remains undone. Here, we report a real-time THz near-field microscope with a high dynamic range that can capture images of a 370 x 740 {\mu}m2 area at 35 frames per second. We achieve high spatial resolution on a large area by combining two novel techniques: THz pulse generation by tilted-pulse-front excitation7 and electro-optic (EO) balanced imaging detection using a thin crystal. To demonstrate the microscope capability, we reveal the field enhancement at the gap position of a dipole antenna after the irradiation of a THz pulse.

However, due to the long wavelength of the THz wave, the obtained resolution of THz imaging is normally a few hundred microns and is much lower than that of the traditional optical imaging. We introduce a sub-wavelength resolution THz imaging technique which uses the THz radiation generated by a femtosecond laser filament in air as the probe. This method is based on the fact that the femtosecond laser filament forms a waveguide for the THz wave in air. The diameter of the THz beam, which propagates inside the filament, varies from 20 {\mu}m to 50 {\mu}m, which is significantly smaller than the wavelength of the THz wave. Using this highly spatially confined THz beam as the probe, THz imaging with resolution as high as 20 {\mu}m (~{\lambda}/38) can be realized.",Terahertz imaging with sub-wavelength resolution by femtosecond laser   filament in air

These make the system bulk and complicated for the reflection-type measurement. In this paper, we propose a novel THz-TDS endoscope that is specifically designed for reflection-type measurement. This THz-TDS endoscope is benefited from an integrated photoconductive antenna (we call it iPCA), which integrates the emitter and receiver on a single antenna chip. Therefore, the dimension of the endoscope can be shrunk as much as possible for practical usage. We present the design and working principle of this THz-TDS endoscope in details.

In this work, the radiative energy transfer between two adjacent non--overlapping spheres of arbitrary diameters and gaps is analyzed numerically.

The aim of the present work is to get analytical expressions describing the nonlinear dynamical properties of the oscillator in noncontact and intermittent contact situations in the tapping mode. Three situations are investigated: the pure attractive interaction, the pure repulsive interaction, and a mixing of the two. The analytical solutions obtained allow general trends to be extracted: the noncontact and the intermittent contact show a very discriminate variation of the phase. Therefore the measurement of the phase becomes a simple way to identify whether or not the tip touches the surface during the oscillating period. It is also found that the key parameter governing the structure of the dynamical properties is the product of the quality factor by a reduced stiffness. In the attractive regime, the reduced stiffness is the ratio of an attractive effective stiffness and the cantilever one. In the repulsive regime, the reduced stiffness is the ratio between the contact stiffness and the cantilever one. The quality factor plays an important role. For large values of the quality factor; it is predicted that a pure topography can be obtained whatever the value of the contact stiffness. For a smaller quality factor, the oscillator becomes more sensitive to change of the local mechanical properties.

Both approaches reveal a non-stationary regime, which has no counterpart in the case of monodisperse granular gases. Specifically, when the mass difference between the two species exceeds a certain threshold the populations display a bistable behavior, with particles of each species switching back and forth between compartments.

187,2,0506421v1,"Recent experimental results on granular gas in Knudsen regime excited by a vibrating piston in micro-gravity have measured distribution p(I) of impacts I with a fix target. They give p(I) scaling as exp(-I/Io). This distribution leads to a probability distribution function of speed v along z varying approximately as f(v) scaling as (1/v) exp(-v/vo); hence it diverges as 1/v at small speed and it is quite non Boltzmannian at large speed. Here, a model is proposed, which explains these experimental impact distributions; it takes account of the true role of the boundaries and of the dissipation in the gas. This validates the experimental data. Different approximations are discussed. Roles of boundaries and of 0-g condition are investigated theoretically. It is argued that the piston plays the role of an impact generator or a ""velostat"" for the Knudsen gas. These results cast a doubt on the efficiency of the notion of Boltzmann temperature and on the necessity to refer to Boltzman distribution in such dilute systems. The model shows also that the medium has to be considered as a whole, in global equilibrium: each part of the system is exchanging with the whole (at least in the direction of vibration); this is quite different from classic approach of dissipative systems based on local exchange and equilibrium, which leads to a ""diffusive"" Boltzmann equation; here the distribution f(z,t) is mainly propagative, i.e. f(z,v,t+dt)=f(z-vdt,v,t) instead of diffusive.

187,4,0507267v1,"Theory of granular dissipative gas is discussed based on Boltzmann's equation and in view of recent experimental results in micro-gravity during few CNES and ESA campaigns [9,11]. It is recalled that the Boltzmann's distribution is a steady solution only when collisions are elastic; hence it is not applicable in the case of dissipative granular gas. The first experimental case concerns non-interacting balls in a vibrated cylindrical box, which proves that rotation-induced dissipation has important consequence: it reduces the efficient phase space dimension of this billiard-like system from 13-d to 1-d, since the motion is 1d and quasi-periodic for large enough forcing; the result remains valid with 2 balls. The second experiment concern the dynamics of interacting particles in the case of a small number (N= 12,24,36,48) of grains: The typical speed of a balls is found to vary linearly with the piston speed, but decreases when the number of balls N increases. The distribution of waiting times T1 between successive ball-gauge collisions follows an exponential distribution experimentally, i.e. P(T1)= exp(-T1/To), proving uncorrelated motions of balls. The amplitude I of the ball-gauge impacts is found to decrease exponentially p(I)=exp(-I/Io).This is temptatively explained using a model ""a la Boltzmann"" associated with the notion of ""velostat"", and a second model is proposed based on dissipation.

For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks. Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked, and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently, fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely shared by different reactions.

Their magnetization is calculated by means of a weak formulation in the magnetostatic approximation of the Maxwell equations (A-phi formulation). An implicit method is used for the temporal resolution (Backward Euler scheme) and is solved in the open source solver GetDP. Picard iterations are used to deal with the power law conductivity of HTS. The finite element formulation is validated for an HTS tube with large pinning strength through the comparison with results obtained with other well-established methods.

However, if magnetic materials such as magnetic substrates of the tapes lie between the two layers, or if the winding pitch angles are not opposite and essentially equal in magnitude to each other, current distributes unequally between the two layers. Then, if at some point in the ac cycle the current of either of the two layers exceeds its critical current, a large ac loss arises from the transfer of flux between the two layers.

A purely thermodynamic formulation of the probability for absorption is obtained from the standard relationship between microstates and entropy. If /DeltaS>>1 and s<<u/T then the probability for the particle not to be absorbed is approximately exp[-u/T], which is identical to the probability for quantum mechanical reflection by the horizon of a ScBH.

The linear Granger approach, to detect cause-effect relationships between time series, has emerged in recent years as a leading statistical technique to accomplish this task. Here we generalize Granger causality to the nonlinear case using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our method performs linear Granger causality in the feature space of suitable kernel functions, assuming arbitrary degree of nonlinearity. We develop a new strategy to cope with the problem of overfitting, based on the geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

205,4,0711.2855v1,"Computing Granger causal relations among bivariate experimentally observed time series has received increasing attention over the past few years. Such causal relations, if correctly estimated, can yield significant insights into the dynamical organization of the system being investigated. Since experimental measurements are inevitably contaminated by noise, it is thus important to understand the effects of such noise on Granger causality estimation. The first goal of this paper is to provide an analytical and numerical analysis of this problem. Specifically, we show that, due to noise contamination, (1) spurious causality between two measured variables can arise and (2) true causality can be suppressed. The second goal of the paper is to provide a denoising strategy to mitigate this problem. Specifically, we propose a denoising algorithm based on the combined use of the Kalman filter theory and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the denoising approach.",Mitigating the effects of measurement noise on Granger causality
205,5,0803.2881v1,"We propose a method of analysis of dynamical networks based on a recent measure of Granger causality between time series, based on kernel methods. The generalization of kernel Granger causality to the multivariate case, here presented, shares the following features with the bivariate measures: (i) the nonlinearity of the regression model can be controlled by choosing the kernel function and (ii) the problem of false-causalities, arising as the complexity of the model increases, is addressed by a selection strategy of the eigenvectors of a reduced Gram matrix whose range represents the additional features due to the second time series. Moreover, there is no {\it a priori} assumption that the network must be a directed acyclic graph. We apply the proposed approach to a network of chaotic maps and to a simulated genetic regulatory network: it is shown that the underlying topology of the network can be reconstructed from time series of node's dynamics, provided that a sufficient number of samples is available. Considering a linear dynamical network, built by preferential attachment scheme, we show that for limited data use of bivariate Granger causality is a better choice w.r.t methods using $L1$ minimization. Finally we consider real expression data from HeLa cells, 94 genes and 48 time points. The analysis of static correlations between genes reveals two modules corresponding to well known transcription factors; Granger analysis puts in evidence nineteen causal relationships, all involving genes related to tumor development.",Kernel Granger causality and the analysis of dynamical networks

However, such a simple task as computing the electronic energy of a hydrogen molecular cation, H$_2^+$, is not possible for a general VQE protocol because the calculation will invariably collapse to a lower energy of the corresponding neutral form, H$_2$. The origin of the problem is that VQE effectively performs an unconstrained energy optimization in the Fock space of the original electronic problem. We show how this can be avoided by introducing necessary constraints directing VQE to the electronic state of interest. The proposed constrained VQE can find an electronic state with a certain number of electrons, spin, or any other property. The new algorithm does not require any additional quantum resources.

A technique introduced in [Higgot et al., Quantum 3, 156 (2019)], which is named variational quantum deflation (VQD), has extended the ability of the VQE framework for finding excited states of a Hamiltonian. However, no method to evaluate transition amplitudes between the eigenstates found by the VQD without using any costly Hadamard-test-like circuit has been proposed despite its importance for computing properties of the system such as oscillator strengths of molecules. Here we propose a method to evaluate transition amplitudes between the eigenstates obtained by the VQD avoiding any Hadamard-test-like circuit. Our method relies only on the ability to estimate overlap between two states, so it does not restrict to the VQD eigenstates and applies for general situations. To support the significance of our method, we provide a comprehensive comparison of three previously proposed methods to find excited states with numerical simulation of three molecules (lithium hydride, diazene, and azobenzene) in a noiseless situation and find that the VQD method exhibits the best performance among the three methods. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our method by calculating the oscillator strength of lithium hydride, comparing results from numerical simulations and real-hardware experiments on the cloud enabled quantum computer IBMQ Rome.

This approach uses training data obtained through full-wave EM simulations of a series of nanostructures to train geometric deep learning algorithms to assess the range of feasible responses as well as the feasibility of a desired response from a class of EM nanostructures. To facilitate the knowledge discovery and reduce the computation complexity, our approach combines the dimensionality reduction technique (using an autoencoder) with convex-hull and one-class support-vector-machine (SVM) algorithms to find the range of the feasible responses in the latent (or the reduced) response space of the EM nanostructure. We show that by using a small set of training instances (compared to all possible structures), our approach can provide better than 95% accuracy in assessing the feasibility of a given response. More importantly, the one-class SVM algorithm can be trained to provide the degree of feasibility (or unfeasibility) of a response from a given nanostructure. This important information can be used to modify the initial structure to an alternative one that can enable an initially unfeasible response. To show the applicability of our approach, we apply it to two important classes of binary metasurfaces (MSs), formed by array of plasmonic nanostructures, and periodic MSs formed by an array of dielectric nanopillars. In addition to theoretical results, we show the experimental results obtained by fabricating several MSs of the second class.

From these bound and continuum states we extract the momentum-dependent phase shifts for s-wave scattering. A surprising finding of this work is that a commonly studied effective-mass mode for excitons in a 10 nm quantum well actually supports two bound biexciton states. The second, weakly bound state may dramatically enhance exciton-exciton interactions.

213,1,0504184v1,"We study the performance of Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in gaseous He, Ne and Ne+H2 at temperatures in the range of 2.6-293 K. In He, at temperatures between 62 and 293 K, the triple-GEM structures often operate at rather high gains, exceeding 1000. There is an indication that this high gain is achieved by Penning effect in the gas impurities released by outgassing. At lower temperatures the gain-voltage characteristics are significantly modified probably due to the freeze-out of impurities. In particular, the double-GEM and single-GEM structures can operate down to 2.6 K at gains reaching only several tens at a gas density of about 0.5 g/l; at higher densities the maximum gain drops further. In Ne, the maximum gain also drops at cryogenic temperatures. The gain drop in Ne at low temperatures can be reestablished in Penning mixtures of Ne+H2: very high gains, exceeding 10000, have been obtained in these mixtures at 50-60 K, at a density of 9.2 g/l corresponding to that of saturated Ne vapor near 27 K.

We discovered that RETGEMs can operate stably and at high gains in noble gases and in other badly quenched gases, such as mixtures of noble gases with air and in pure air; therefore, a wide range of practical applications, including dosimetry and detection of dangerous gases, is foreseeable. To promote a better understanding of RETGEM technology some comparative studies were completed with metallic-electrode thick GEMs. A primary benefit of these new RETGEMs is that the screen printing technology is easily accessible to many research laboratories.

This analogy emerges when one introduces the effective acoustic metric for quasiparticles. In the rotating frame this metric has an ergosurface, which is similar to the ergosurface in the metric of a rotating black hole.

In the antiadiabatic regime, accounting on the same footing for a finite phonon frequency and a finite electron bandwidth allows to address the evolution of the optical absorption away from the well-understood molecular limit. It is shown that the width of the multiphonon peaks in the optical spectra depends on the temperature and on the frequency in a way that contradicts the commonly accepted results, most notably in the strong coupling case. In the adiabatic regime, on the other hand, the present method allows to identify a wide range of parameters of experimental interest, where the electron bandwidth is comparable or larger than the broadening of the Franck-Condon line, leading to a strong modification of both the position and the shape of the polaronic absorption. An analytical expression is derived in the limit of vanishing broadening, which improves over the existing formulas and whose validity extends to any finite-dimensional lattice.

Moreover, even if a proper reaction coordinate can be found, ergodic sampling will be a challenge. In this article, we discuss the recent advancements of path sampling methods to tackle this problem. We argue why the path sampling methods, via the transition interface sampling technique, is less sensitive to the choice of reaction coordinate. Moreover, we review a new algorithm, parallel path swapping, that can dramatically improve the ergodic sampling of trajectories for the multiple reaction channel systems.",Efficient path sampling on multiple reaction channels

221,4,0907.4776v1,"Existing optimal estimators of nonequilibrium path-ensemble averages are shown to fall within the framework of extended bridge sampling. Using this framework, we derive a general minimal-variance estimator that can combine nonequilibrium trajectory data sampled from multiple path-ensembles to estimate arbitrary functions of nonequilibrium expectations. The framework is also applied to obtaining asymptotic variance estimates, which are a useful measure of statistical uncertainty. In particular, we develop asymptotic variance estimates pertaining to Jarzynski's equality for free energies and the Hummer-Szabo expressions for the potential of mean force, calculated from uni- or bidirectional path samples. Lastly, they are demonstrated on a model single-molecule pulling experiment. In these simulations, the asymptotic variance expression is found to accurately characterize the confidence intervals around estimators when the bias is small. Hence, it does not work well for unidirectional estimates with large bias, but for this model it largely reflects the true error in a bidirectional estimator derived by Minh and Adib.",Optimal estimators and asymptotic variances for nonequilibrium   path-ensemble averages
221,5,0911.2090v2,"We develop an efficient sampling and free energy calculation technique within the adaptive biasing potential (ABP) framework. By mollifying the density of states we obtain an approximate free energy and an adaptive bias potential that is computed directly from the population along the coordinates of the free energy. Because of the mollifier, the bias potential is ""nonlocal"" and its gradient admits a simple analytic expression. A single observation of the reaction coordinate can thus be used to update the approximate free energy at every point within a neighborhood of the observation. This greatly reduces the equilibration time of the adaptive bias potential. This approximation introduces two parameters: strength of mollification and the zero of energy of the bias potential. While we observe that the approximate free energy is a very good estimate of the actual free energy for a large range of mollification strength, we demonstrate that the errors associated with the mollification may be removed via deconvolution. The zero of energy of the bias potential, which is easy to choose, influences the speed of convergence but not the limiting accuracy. This method is simple to apply to free energy or mean force computation in multiple dimensions and does not involve second derivatives of the reaction coordinates, matrix manipulations nor on-the-fly adaptation of parameters. For the alanine dipeptide test case, the new method is found to gain as much as a factor of ten in efficiency as compared to two common adaptive biasing force formulations and it is shown to be as efficient as well-tempered metadynamics with the post-process deconvolution giving a clear advantage to the mollified density of states method.",Free energy calculations: An efficient adaptive biasing potential method

We introduce several modifications to the invasion percolation (MIP) to incorporate fracture inclinations, intersection lines, as well as the hydraulic path length inside the fractures. Additionally a trapping algorithm is implemented that forbids any advance of the invading fluid into a region, where the defending fluid is completely encircled by the invader and has no escape route.

It is shown that when neglecting the lag between the liquid front and the crack tip, the lubrication PDE yields that a solution satisfies the speed equation identically. This implies that for zero or small lag, the boundary value problem appears ill-posed when solved numerically. We suggest e - regularization, which consists in employing the speed equation together with a prescribed BC on the front to obtain a new BC formulated at a small distance behind the front rather than on the front itself. It is shown that - regularization provides accurate and stable results with reasonable time expense.

The formalism is an effective continuum model that captures the coupled dynamics of the fluid pressure and the fractured rock matrix and models both the tensile and shear failure of the rock. As an application of the formalism, we study the geomechanical stress interaction between two injection points during hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracking) and how this interaction influences the fracturing process. For injection points that are separated by less than a critical correlation length, we find that the fracturing process around each point is strongly correlated with the position of the neighboring point. The magnitude of the correlation length depends on the degree of heterogeneity of the rock and is on the order of 30-45 m for rocks with low permeabilities. In the strongly correlated regime, we predict a novel effective fracture-force that attracts the fractures toward the neighboring injection point.",Interaction between Injection Points during Hydraulic Fracturing
222,5,1208.1847v1,"The paper aims to answer the question: if and how non-Newtonian fluids may be compared in their mechanical action when used for hydraulic fracturing? By employing the modified formulation of the PKN problem we obtain its simple analytical solutions in the cases of perfectly plastic and Newtonian fluids. Since the results for shear thinning fluids are intermediate between those for these cases, the obtained equation for the fracture length suggests a criterion of the equivalence of various shear thinning fluids for the problem of hydraulic fractures. We assume fluids equivalent in their hydrofracturing action, when at a reference time they produce fractures of the same length. The equation for the fracture length translates the equivalence in terms of the hydraulic fracture length and treatment time into the equivalence in terms of the properties of a fracturing fluid (behavior and consistency indices). Analysis shows that the influence of the consistency and behavior indices on the fracture length, particle velocity and propagation speed is quite similar when considering the PKN and KGD models despite the models refer to different plain-strain states. It appears that from the mechanical point of view, the differences between thinning fluids are not significant; they may be taken into account when wishing to have some quantity to be greater (less) at small (large) time. We conclude that a choice of a fracturing fluid is to be made mostly from technological and/or economic considerations under the condition that the compared fluids are equivalent in their mechanical effect according to the suggested criterion.",On equivalence of thinning fluids used for hydraulic fracturing

The cooperative feature in correspondence to the spectroscopic signal is specified. The results reveal the dark states by the cross peaks apart from the ones for polaritons, as a result of the breakdown of cooperativity between molecules.

We work with a model system for the molecule (Shin-Metiu model) in which nuclear, electronic and photonic degrees of freedom are treated on the same footing. This simplified model allows the comparison of exact quantum reaction rate calculations with predictions emerging from transition state theory based on the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approach. We demonstrate that QED effects are indeed able to significantly modify activation barriers in chemical reactions and, as a consequence, reaction rates. The critical physical parameter controlling this effect is the permanent dipole of the molecule and how this magnitude changes along the reaction coordinate. We show that the effective coupling can lead to significant single-molecule energy shifts in an experimentally available nanoparticle-on-mirror cavity. We then apply the validated theory to a realistic case (internal rotation in the 1,2-dichloroethane molecule), showing how reactions can be inhibited or catalyzed depending on the profile of the molecular dipole. Furthermore, we discuss the absence of resonance effects in this process, which can be understood through its connection to Casimir-Polder forces. Finally, we treat the case of many-molecule strong coupling, and find collective modifications of reaction rates if the molecular permanent dipole moments are oriented with respected to the cavity field. This demonstrates that collective coupling can also provide a mechanism for modifying ground-state chemical reactivity of an ensemble of molecules coupled to a cavity mode.",Cavity Casimir-Polder forces and their effects in ground state chemical   reactivity

The effect of white noise is investigated, where the critical point transmutes into a non-hermitian ``degenerate region''.

225,3,0708.0278v2,"We study the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 anisotropic XY model in a transverse field when the transverse field or the anisotropic interaction is quenched at a slow but uniform rate. The two quenching schemes are called transverse and anisotropic quenching respectively. Our emphasis in this paper is on the anisotropic quenching scheme and we compare the results with those of the other scheme. In the process of anisotropic quenching, the system crosses all the quantum critical lines of the phase diagram where the relaxation time diverges. The evolution is non-adiabatic in the time interval when the parameters are close to their critical values, and is adiabatic otherwise. The density of defects produced due to non-adiabatic transitions is calculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener problem and is generally found to vary as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the characteristic time scale of quenching, a scenario that supports the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Interestingly, in the case of anisotropic quenching, there exists an additional non-adiabatic transition, in comparison to the transverse quenching case, with the corresponding probability peaking at an incommensurate value of the wave vector. In the special case in which the system passes through a multi-critical point, the defect density is found to vary as $1/\tau^{1/6}$.

A single passage from $h \to - \infty$ to $h \to +\infty$ or the other way around is referred to as a half-period of quenching. For an even number of half-periods, the transverse field is brought back to the initial value of $-\infty$; in the case of an odd number of half-periods, the dynamics is stopped at $h \to +\infty$. The density of defects produced due to the non-adiabatic transitions is calculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener problem and is generally found to vary as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ for large $\tau$; however, the magnitude is found to depend on the number of half-periods of quenching. For two successive half-periods, the defect density is found to decrease in comparison to a single half-period, suggesting the existence of a corrective mechanism in the reverse path. A similar behavior of the density of defects and the local entropy is observed for repeated quenching. The defect density decays as $1/{\sqrt\tau}$ for large $\tau$ for any number of half-periods, and shows a increase in kink density for small $\tau$ for an even number; the entropy shows qualitatively the same behavior for any number of half-periods.

We argue that when a quantum system is quenched across a multicritical point, the density of defects ($n$) in the final state is not necessarily given by the Kibble-Zurek scaling form $n \sim 1/\tau^{d \nu/(z \nu +1)}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension, and $\nu$ and $z$ are respectively the correlation length and dynamical exponent associated with the quantum critical point. We propose a generalized scaling form of the defect density given by $n \sim 1/\tau^{d/(2z_2)}$, where the exponent $z_2$ determines the behavior of the off-diagonal term of the $2 \times 2$ Landau-Zener matrix at the multicritical point.

228,2,0710.2264v1,"Reaction networks in the bulk and on surfaces are widespread in physical, chemical and biological systems. In macroscopic systems, which include large populations of reactive species, stochastic fluctuations are negligible and the reaction rates can be evaluated using rate equations. However, many physical systems are partitioned into microscopic domains, where the number of molecules in each domain is small and fluctuations are strong. Under these conditions, the simulation of reaction networks requires stochastic methods such as direct integration of the master equation. However, direct integration of the master equation is infeasible for complex networks, because the number of equations proliferates as the number of reactive species increases. Recently, the multiplane method, which provides a dramatic reduction in the number of equations, was introduced [A. Lipshtat and O. Biham, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 170601 (2004)]. The reduction is achieved by breaking the network into a set of maximal fully connected sub-networks (maximal cliques). Lower-dimensional master equations are constructed for the marginal probability distributions associated with the cliques, with suitable couplings between them. In this paper we test the multiplane method and examine its applicability. We show that the method is accurate in the limit of small domains, where fluctuations are strong. It thus provides an efficient framework for the stochastic simulation of complex reaction networks with strong fluctuations, for which rate equations fail and direct integration of the master equation is infeasible. The method also applies in the case of large domains, where it converges to the rate equation results.",Evaluation of the Multiplane Method for Efficient Simulations of   Reaction Networks

Intriguing as these possibilities are, there still remain many important hurdles to overcome before nanomechanical structures approach anything close to their full potential. With their high surface-to-volume ratios and sub-micron dimensions, nanomechanical structures are strongly affected by processing irregularities and susceptible to nonlinear effects. There are several ways of dealing with nonlinearity: exceptional fabrication process control in order to minimize the onset of nonlinear effects or taking advantage of the interesting and oftentimes counterintuitive consequences of nonlinearity. Here, we present evidence for the use of stochastic resonance as a means of coherent signal amplification for use in nanomechanical devices. Aside from being simply one more system in which the phenomenon has been demonstrated, nanoscale systems \cite{lee03} are interesting because of their proximity to the realm of quantum mechanics. The combination of stochastic resonance and quantum mechanics has been the subject of intense theoretical activities \cite{wellens00, goychuk99, grif96, lof94} for many years; nanomechanical systems present a fertile ground for the study of a broad variety of novel phenomena in quantum stochastic resonance. Additionally, the physical realization of such nonlinear nanomechanical strings offer the possibility of studying a whole class of phase transition phenomena, particularly those modeled by a Landau-Ginzburg quantum string \cite{benzi85, hu99}.",Signal Processing and Control in Nonlinear Nanomechanical Systems
229,4,0603108v1,"Stochastic resonance is a counter-intuitive concept[1,2], ; the addition of noise to a noisy system induces coherent amplification of its response. First suggested as a mechanism for the cyclic recurrence of ice ages, stochastic resonance has been seen in a wide variety of macroscopic physical systems: bistable ring lasers[3], SQUIDs[4,5], magnetoelastic ribbons[6], and neurophysiological systems such as the receptors in crickets[7] and crayfish[8]. Although it is fundamentally important as a mechanism of coherent signal amplification, stochastic resonance is yet to be observed in nanoscale systems. Here we report the observation of stochastic resonance in bistable nanomechanical silicon oscillators, which can play an important role in the realization of controllable high-speed nanomechanical memory cells. Our nanomechanical systems were excited into a dynamic bistable state and modulated in order to induce controllable switching; the addition of white noise showed a marked amplification of the signal strength.

This behavior can be exploited to achieve noise squeezing in the output signal when homodyne detection is employed for readout. We show that mass sensitivity of the device in this region may exceed the upper bound imposed by thermomechanical noise upon the sensitivity when operating in the linear region. On the other hand, we show that the high mass sensitivity is accompanied by a slowing down of the response of the system to a change in the mass.",Mass Detection with Nonlinear Nanomechanical Resonator

Exact steady-state analytical expressions are obtained for velocities and dispersions for any number of intermediate states and conformations between the corresponding binding states of proteins. These models enabled a detailed description and comparison of two possible mechanisms of the motion of motor proteins along the linear tracks: the hand-over-hand mechanism when the motion of subunits alternate, and the inchworm mechanism when one subunit is always trailing another one. It is shown that particles in the hand-over-hand mechanism move faster and fluctuate more than the molecules in the inchworm mechanism.

We begin by investigating the properties of the aggressive driving model (ADM), a simple cellular automata-based model of vehicular traffic, a unique feature of which is that it allows a natural extension to capture the essential features of dynein motor traffic. We first calculate several collective properties of the ADM, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, analytically using two different mean-field approaches as well as by carrying out computer simulations. Then we extend the ADM by incorporating the possibilities of attachment and detachment of motors on the track which is a common feature of a large class of motor proteins that are collectively referred to as cytoskeletal motors. The interplay of the boundary and bulk dynamics of attachment and detachment of the motors to the track gives rise a phase where high and low density phases separated by a stable domain wall coexist. We also compare and contrast our results with the model of Parmeggiani et. al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 90}, 086601 (2003)) which can be regarded as a minimal model for traffic of a closely related family of motor proteins called kinesin.

Here we generalize this model, introducing a novel interaction parameter $c$, to account for an interesting mechano-chemical process which has not been considered in any earlier model. We have been able to extract all the parameters of the model, except $c$, from experimentally measured quantities. In contrast to earlier models of intra-cellular molecular motor traffic, our model assigns distinct ``chemical'' (or, conformational) states to each kinesin to account for the hydrolysis of ATP, the chemical fuel of the motor. Our model makes experimentally testable theoretical predictions. We determine the phase diagram of the model in planes spanned by experimentally controllable parameters, namely, the concentrations of kinesins and ATP.

The use of LIAD at short wavelengths allows for fast switching of the desired vapor pressure and permits experiments with long trapping and coherence times. The wavelength dependence of the LIAD effect for both species was explored in a range from 630 nm to 253 nm in an uncoated quartz cell and a stainless steel chamber. Only a few mW/cm^2 of near-UV light produce partial pressures that are high enough to saturate a magneto-optical trap at 3.5 x 10^9 Rb atoms or 7 x 10^7 K atoms. Loading rates as high as 1.2 x 10^9 Rb atoms/s and 8 x 10^7 K atoms/s were achieved without the use of a secondary atom source.

A simple and precise model of such a slower based on magnetic dipoles is developed. The theory of a general Zeeman slower is modified to include spatial nonuniformity of the slowing laser beam intensity due to its convergence and absorption by slowed atoms. The slower needs no high currents or water cooling and the spatial distribution of its magnetic field can be adjusted. In addition the slower provides a possibility to cool the slowed atoms transversally along the whole length of the slower.

These cells can be easily replaced, while keeping the rest of the apparatus unchanged: atomic sources, vacuum conditions, magnetic field gradients, sizes and power of the laser beams, detection system. By direct comparison, we find that the trapping efficiency only weakly depends on the MOT cell size. It is also found that the trapping efficiency of the MOT with the smallest cell, whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the trapping beams, is about 40% smaller than the efficiency of larger cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the importance of two factors: a long coated tube at the entrance of the MOT cell, used instead of a diaphragm; and the passivation with an alkali vapor of the coating on the cell walls, in order to minimize the losses of trappable atoms. These results guided us in the construction of an efficient large-diameter cell, which has been successfully employed for on-line trapping of Fr isotopes at INFN's national laboratories in Legnaro, Italy.",Experimental study of vapor-cell magneto-optical traps for efficient   trapping of radioactive atoms

234,1,0604021v1,"A prominent chemical reaction in interstellar clouds is the formation of molecular hydrogen by recombination, which essentially takes place on dust grain surfaces. Analytical approaches to model such a system have hitherto neglected the spatial aspects of the problem by employing a simplistic version of the sweeping rate of reactants. We show how these aspects can be accounted for by a consistent definition of the sweeping rate, and calculate it exactly for a spherical grain. Two regimes can be identified: Small grains, on which two reactants almost surely meet, and large grains, where this is very unlikely. We compare the true sweeping rate to the conventional approximation and find a characteristic reduction in both regimes, most pronounced for large grains. These effects can be understood heuristically using known results from the analysis of two-dimensional random walks. We finally examine the influence of using the true sweeping rate in the calculation of the efficiency of hydrogen recombination: For fixed temperature, the efficiency can be reduced considerably, and relative to that, small grains gain in importance, but the temperature window in which recombination is efficient is not changed substantially.",The sweeping rate in diffusion-mediated reactions on dust grain surfaces
234,2,0708.1647v2,The study of the formation of molecular hydrogen on low temperature surfaces is of interest both because it allows to explore elementary steps in the heterogeneous catalysis of a simple molecule and because of the applications in astrochemistry. Here we report results of experiments of molecular hydrogen formation on amorphous silicate surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). In these experiments beams of H and D atoms are irradiated on the surface of an amorphous silicate sample. The desorption rate of HD molecules is monitored using a mass spectrometer during a subsequent TPD run. The results are analyzed using rate equations and the activation energies of the processes leading to molecular hydrogen formation are obtained from the TPD data. We show that a model based on a single isotope provides the correct results for the activation energies for diffusion and desorption of H atoms.

The present work aims at collecting experimental evidence for how the bond energy budget of H2 is distributed between the reaction site and the internal energy of the molecule. So far, the non-detection of excited nascent H2 in dense quiescent clouds could be a sign that either predictions of emission line intensities are not correct or the de-excitation of the newly formed molecules proceeds rapidly on the grain surface itself. In this letter we present experimental evidence that interstellar molecular hydrogen is formed and then rapidly de-excited on the surface of porous water ice mantles. In addition, although we detect ro-vibrationally excited nascent molecules desorbing from a bare non-porous (compact) water ice film, we demonstrate that the amount of excited nascent hydrogen molecules is significantly reduced no matter the morphology of the water ice substrate at 10 K (both on non-porous and on porous water ice) in a regime of high molecular coverage as is the case in dark molecular clouds.",Laboratory evidence for the non-detection of excited nascent H2 in dark   clouds

234,5,1111.6477v1,"Context. The formation of water on the dust grains in the interstellar medium may proceed with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an intermediate. Recently gas-phase H2O2 has been detected in {\rho} Oph A with an abundance of ~1E-10 relative to H2.   Aims. We aim to reproduce the observed abundance of H2O2 and other species detected in {\rho} Oph A quantitatively.   Methods. We make use of a chemical network which includes gas phase reactions as well as processes on the grains; desorption from the grain surface through chemical reaction is also included. We run the model for a range of physical parameters.   Results. The abundance of H2O2 can be best reproduced at ~6E5 yr, which is close to the dynamical age of {\rho} Oph A. The abundances of other species such as H2CO, CH3OH, and O2 can be reasonably reproduced also at this time. In the early time the gas-phase abundance of H2O2 can be much higher than the current detected value. We predict a gas phase abundance of O2H at the same order of magnitude as H2O2, and an abundance of the order 1E-8 for gas phase water in {\rho} Oph A. A few other species of interest are also discussed.   Conclusions. We demonstrate that H2O2 can be produced on the dust grains and released into the gas phase through non-thermal desorption via surface exothermic reactions. The H2O2 molecule on the grain is an important intermediate in the formation of water. The fact that H2O2 is over-produced in the gas phase for a range of physical conditions suggests that its destruction channel in the current gas phase network may be incomplete.",Production of interstellar hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the surface of   dust grains

235,2,0808.3592v2,We present an accurate quantum mechanical study of molecule-molecule collisions in the presence of a magnetic field. The work focusses on the analysis of elastic scattering and spin relaxation in collisions of O2(3Sigma_g) molecules at cold (~0.1 K) and ultracold (~10^{-6} K) temperatures. Our calculations show that magnetic spin relaxation in molecule-molecule collisions is extremely efficient except at magnetic fields below 1 mT. The rate constant for spin relaxation at T=0.1 K and a magnetic field of 0.1 T is found to be as large as 6.1 x 10^{-11} cm3/s. The magnetic field dependence of elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections at ultracold temperatures is dominated by a manifold of Feshbach resonances with the density of ~100 resonances per Tesla for collisions of molecules in the absolute ground state. This suggests that the scattering length of ultracold molecules in the absolute ground state can be effectively tuned in a very wide range of magnetic fields. Our calculations demonstrate that the number and properties of the magnetic Feshbach resonances are dramatically different for molecules in the absolute ground and excited spin states.

This is in stark contrast to the dilute gases of ultracold atoms, which have isotropic and extremely short-range, or ""contact"", interactions. The large electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned with an external electric field; this provides unique opportunities such as control of ultracold chemical reactions, quantum information processing, and the realization of novel quantum many-body systems. In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules, only recently have sufficiently high densities been achieved. Here, we report the observation of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum degeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a dramatic increase in the loss rate of fermionic KRb molecules due to ultrcold chemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence on the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be understood with a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for scattering of fermionic polar molecules. We directly observe the spatial anisotropy of the dipolar interaction as manifested in measurements of the thermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range dipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction rates in an ultracold polar molecule gas. The large loss rates in an applied electric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble of ultracold polar molecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to suppress the influence of the attractive dipolar interactions.",Dipolar collisions of polar molecules in the quantum regime

237,1,1204.3349v3,"Topological phases have been explored in various fields in physics such as spintronics, photonics, liquid helium, correlated electron system and cold-atomic system. This leads to the recent foundation of emerging materials such as topological band insulators, topological photonic crystals and topological superconductors/superfluid. In this paper, we propose a topological magnonic crystal which provides protected chiral edge modes for magnetostatic spin waves. Based on a linearized Landau-Lifshitz equation, we show that a magnonic crystal with the dipolar interaction acquires spin-wave volume-mode band with non-zero Chern integer. We argue that such magnonic systems are accompanied by the same integer numbers of chiral spin-wave edge modes within a band gap for the volume-mode bands. In these edge modes, the spin wave propagates in a unidirectional manner without being scattered backward, which implements novel fault-tolerant spintronic devices.",Topological chiral magnonic edge mode in a magnonic crystal
237,2,1210.3487v2,"In the ferromagnetic insulator with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we theoretically predict and numerically verify a topological magnon insulator, where the charge-free magnon is topologically protected to transport along the edge while it is insulating in the bulk. Within the bulk band gaps, edge states form a connected loop as a $4\pi$- or $8\pi$-period M\""{o}bius strip in the wave vector space. As a consequence, the chiral energy current traveling along the corresponding edge is topologically protected from defects or disorders. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we demonstrate that the energy current carried by magnons with energy in the bulk gap localizes at edges and prefers to travel along one edge in only one direction at nonequilibrium steady state. Our prediction about topological magnon insulator could be observed at a wide energy range in the thin film of the insulating ferromagnet, such as Lu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$.",Topological Magnon Insulator in Insulating Ferromagnet
237,3,1603.04331v6,"Quite recently, magnon Hall effect of spin excitations has been observed experimentally on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. Thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa^{xy}$, changes sign as a function of magnetic field or temperature on the kagome lattice, and $\kappa^{xy}$ changes sign upon reversing the sign of the magnetic field on the pyrochlore lattice. Motivated by these recent exciting experimental observations, we theoretically propose a simple realization of magnon Hall effect in a two-band model on the honeycomb lattice. The magnon Hall effect of spin excitations arises in the usual way via the breaking of inversion symmetry of the lattice, however, by a next-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction. We find that $\kappa^{xy}$ has a fixed sign for all parameter regimes considered. These results are in contrast to the Lieb, kagome and pyrochlore lattices. We further show that the low-temperature dependence on the magnon Hall conductivity follows a $T^{2}$ law, as opposed to the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. These results suggest an experimental procedure to measure thermal Hall conductivity within a class of 2D honeycomb quantum magnets and ultracold atoms trapped in honeycomb optical lattice.",Topological honeycomb magnon Hall effect: A calculation of thermal Hall   conductivity of magnetic spin excitations

238,1,0502008v1,"In the last decade, computational studies of liquid water have mostly concentrated on ground state properties. However recent spectroscopic measurements have been used to infer the structure of water, and the interpretation of optical and x-ray spectra requires accurate theoretical models of excited electronic states, not only of the ground state. To this end, we investigate the electronic properties of water at ambient conditions using ab initio density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (DFT/GGA), focussing on the unoccupied subspace of Kohn-Sham eigenstates. We generate long (250 ps) classical trajectories for large supercells, up to 256 molecules, from which uncorrelated configurations of water molecules are extracted for use in DFT/GGA calculations of the electronic structure. We find that the density of occupied states of this molecular liquid is well described with 32 molecule supercells using a single k-point (k = 0) to approximate integration over the first Brillouin zone. However, the description of the density of unoccupied states (u-EDOS) is sensitive to finite size effects. Small, 32 molecule supercell calculations, using Gamma-the point approximation, yield a spuriously isolated state above the Fermi level. Nevertheless, the more accurate u-EDOS of large, 256 molecule supercells may be reproduced using smaller supercells and increased k-point sampling. This indicates that the electronic structure of molecular liquids like water is relatively insensitive to the long-range disorder in the molecular structure. These results have important implications for efficiently increasing the accuracy of spectral calculations for water and other molecular liquids.",The electronic structure of liquid water within density functional   theory

238,3,0508567v1,"It has been generally accepted that there are significant quadrupolar and bulk contributions to the second harmonic generation (SHG) reflected from the neat air/water interface, as well as common liquid interfaces. Because there has been no general methodology to determine the quadrupolar and bulk contributions to the SHG signal from a liquid interface, this conclusion was reached based on the following two experimental phenomena. Namely, the broken of the macroscopic Kleinman symmetry, and the significant temperature dependence of the SHG signal from the neat air/water interface. However, because sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) measurement of the neat air/water interface observed no apparent temperature dependence, the temperature dependence in the SHG measurement has been reexamined and proven to be an experimental artifact. Here we present a complete microscopic analysis of the susceptibility tensors of the air/water interface, and show that dipolar contribution alone can be used to address the issue of broken of the macroscopic Kleinman symmetry at the neat air/water interface. Using this analysis, the orientation of the water molecules at the interface can be obtained, and it is consistent with the measurement from SFG-VS. Therefore, the key rationales to conclude significantly quadrupolar and bulk contributions to the SHG signal of the neat air/water interface can no longer be considered as valid as before. This new understanding of the air/water interface can shed light on our understanding of the nonlinear optical responses from other molecular interfaces as well.",Reconsideration of Second Harmonic Generation from neat Air/Water   Interface: Broken of Kleinman Symmetry from Dipolar Contribution
238,4,0508568v1,"Here we report a detailed study on spectroscopy, structure and dynamics of water molecules at air/water interface, investigated with Sum Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy (SFG-VS). Quantitative polarization and experimental configuration analysis of the SFG data in different polarizations with four sets of experimental configurations can shed new lights on our present understanding of the air/water interface. Firstly, we concluded that the motion of the interfacial water molecules can only be in a limited angular range, instead rapidly varying over a broad angular range in the vibrational relaxation time suggested previously. Secondly, because different vibrational modes of different molecular species at the interface has different symmetry properties, polarization and symmetry analysis of the SFG-VS spectral features can help assignment of the SFG-VS spectra peaks to different interfacial species. These analysis concluded that the narrow 3693cm-1 and broad 3550cm-1 peaks belong to C_ v symmetry, while the broad 3250cm-1 and 3450cm-1 peaks belong to the symmetric stretching modes with C_2v symmetry. Thus, the 3693cm-1 peak is assigned to the free OH, the 3550cm-1 peak is assigned to the single hydrogen bonded OH stretching mode, and the 3250cm-1 and 3450cm-1 peaks are assigned to interfacial water molecules as two hydrogen donors for hydrogen bonding (with C_2v symmetry), respectively. Thirdly, analysis of the SFG-VS spectra concluded that the singly hydrogen bonded water molecules at the air/water interface have their dipole vector direct almost parallel to the interface, and is with a very narrow orientational distribution.

In the U.S., Department of Energy rules require national laboratories to follow national consensus pressure vessel standards or to show ""a level of safety greater than or equal to"" that of the applicable standard. Thus, while used for its superconducting properties, niobium ends up being treated as a low-temperature pressure vessel material. Niobium material is not a code listed material and therefore requires the designer to understand the mechanical properties for material used in each pressure vessel fabrication; compliance with pressure vessel codes therefore becomes a problem.

Nevertheless, we demonstrate theoretically that it is possible to create strongly-enhanced molecular CD utilizing the plasmons. This task is doubly challenging since it requires both creation and enhancement of the molecular CD in the visible region. We demonstrate this effect within the model which incorporates a chiral molecule and a plasmonic dimer.

244,2,1204.3694v3,"We investigate how emergent nematic order and nematic fluctuations affect several macroscopic properties of both the normal and superconducting states of the iron pnictides. Due to its magnetic origin, long-range nematic order enhances magnetic fluctuations, leaving distinctive signatures in the spin-lattice relaxation rate, the spin-spin correlation function, and the uniform magnetic susceptibility. This enhancement of magnetic excitations is also manifested in the electronic spectral function, where a pseudogap can open at the hot spots of the Fermi surface. In the nematic phase, electrons are scattered by magnetic fluctuations that are anisotropic in momentum space, giving rise to a non-zero resistivity anisotropy whose sign changes between electron-doped and hole-doped compounds. We also show that due to the magneto-elastic coupling, nematic fluctuations soften the shear modulus in the normal state, but harden it in the superconducting state. The latter effect is an indirect consequence of the competition between magnetism and superconductivity, and also causes a suppression of the orthorhombic distortion below T_{c}. We also demonstrate that ferro-orbital fluctuations enhance the nematic susceptibility, cooperatively promoting an electronic tetragonal symmetry-breaking.

Extrapolating our findings, we argue that nematicity in non superconducting states of underdoped and undoped pnictides may reflect mixed S_{+-} + d_{x^2-y^2} Density Wave states.",Nematicity from mixed S_{+-} + d_{x^2-y^2} states in iron-based   superconductors

It has separate, but interacting itinerant and localized degrees of freedom, originating from the d_xz and d_yz, and from d_xy iron orbitals respectively. At low temperatures, below a mean-field phase transition, these different states condense together in an excitonic order parameter. We show that at even lower temperature, after another phase transition, this ordered state can spontaneously break the C_4 lattice symmetry and become nematic. We propose this mechanism as an explanation of the tendency towards nematicity observed in several iron-based compounds.",Nematicity driven by hybridization in iron-based superconductors

Recent improvements in planetary orbit determination may yield the first observational evidence of such a tiny effect. Indeed, corrections to the known perihelion rates of -0.0036 +/- 0.0050, -0.0002 +/- 0.0004 and 0.0001 +/- 0.0005 arcseconds per century were recently estimated by E.V. Pitjeva for Mercury, the Earth and Mars, respectively, on the basis of the EPM2004 ephemerides and a set of more than 317,000 observations of various kinds. The predicted relativistic Lense-Thirring precessions for these planets are -0.0020, -0.0001 and -3 10^-5 arcseconds per century, respectively and are compatible with the determined perihelia corrections. The relativistic predictions fit better than the zero-effect hypothesis, especially if a suitable linear combination of the perihelia of Mercury and the Earth, which a priori cancels out any possible bias due to the solar quadrupole mass moment, is considered. However, the experimental errors are still large. Also the latest data for Mercury processed independently by Fienga et al. with the INPOP ephemerides yield preliminary insights about the existence of the solar Lense-Thirring effect. The data from the forthcoming planetary mission BepiColombo will improve our knowledge of the orbital motion of this planet and, consequently, the precision of the measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect. As a by-product of the present analysis, it is also possible to constrain the strength of a Yukawa-like fifth force to a 10^-12-10^-13 level at scales of about one Astronomical Unit (10^11 m).",First preliminary tests of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic   field of the Sun and new constraints on a Yukawa-like fifth force from   planetary data

The Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld scenario, which is a multi-dimensional model of gravity aimed to the explanation of the observed cosmic acceleration without dark energy, predicts, among other things, a perihelion secular shift, due to Lue and Starkman, of 5 10^-4 arcsec cy^-1 for all the planets of the Solar System. It yields a variation of about 6 m cy^-1 for the Earth-Sun distance which is compatible at 1-sigma level with the observed rate of the Astronomical Unit.

One of the most intriguing features of such a model is that it also predicts small effects on the orbital motion of test particles which could be tested in such a way that local measurements at Solar System scales would allow to get information on the global properties of the Universe. Lue and Starkman derived a secular extra-perihelion \omega precession of 5\times 10^-4 arcseconds per century, while Iorio showed that the mean longitude \lambda is affected by a secular precession of about 10^-3 arcseconds per century. Such effects depend only on the eccentricities e of the orbits via second-order terms: they are, instead, independent of their semimajor axes a. Up to now, the observational efforts focused on the dynamics of the inner planets of the Solar System whose orbits are the best known via radar ranging. Since the competing Newtonian and Einsteinian effects like the precessions due to the solar quadrupole mass moment J2, the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic part of the equations of motion reduce with increasing distances, it would be possible to argue that an analysis of the orbital dynamics of the outer planets of the Solar System, with particular emphasis on Saturn because of the ongoing Cassini mission with its precision ranging instrumentation, could be helpful in evidencing the predicted new features of motion. In this note we investigate this possibility in view of the latest results in the planetary ephemeris field.

252,1,0806.2249v2,"The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells based on donor--acceptor blends is governed by an interplay of polaron pair dissociation and bimolecular polaron recombination. Both processes are strongly dependent on the charge carrier mobility, the dissociation increasing with faster charge transport, with raised recombination losses at the same time. Using a macroscopic effective medium simulation, we calculate the optimum charge carrier mobility for the highest power conversion efficiency, for the first time accounting for injection barriers and a reduced Langevin-type recombination. An enhancement of the charge carrier mobility from $10^{-8}$m$^2$/Vs for state of the art polymer:fullerene solar cells to about $10^{-6}$m$^2$/Vs, which yields the maximum efficiency, corresponds to an improvement of only about 20% for the given parameter set.",Influence of Charge Carrier Mobility on the Performance of Organic Solar   Cells

In contrast, considering just the Coulomb binding of the polaron pair, electric fields above $10^8$V/m would be needed to reach similar yields. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of polaron pair dissociation in donor--acceptor blends, considering delocalised charge carriers along conjugated polymer chain segments.

For the random 3-satisfiability problem, the heuristic of focusing the local moves on the presently unsatisfiedclauses is known to be very effective: the time to solution has been observed to grow only linearly in the number of variables, for a given clauses-to-variables ratio $\alpha$ sufficiently far below the critical satisfiability threshold $\alpha_c \approx 4.27$. We present numerical results on the behaviour of three focused local search algorithms for this problem, considering in particular the characteristics of a focused variant of the simple Metropolis dynamics. We estimate the optimal value for the ``temperature'' parameter $\eta$ for this algorithm, such that its linear-time regime extends as close to $\alpha_c$ as possible. Similar parameter optimisation is performed also for the well-known WalkSAT algorithm and for the less studied, but very well performing Focused Record-to-Record Travel method. We observe that with an appropriate choice of parameters, the linear time regime for each of these algorithms seems to extend well into ratios $\alpha > 4.2$ -- much further than has so far been generally assumed.

This result is consistent with the clustering scenario which is at the heart of the recent heuristic analysis of satisfiability using statistical physics analysis (the cavity method), and its algorithmic counterpart (the survey propagation algorithm).

In the infinite N limit, Psuccess vanishes at some critical ratio alpha\_H which depends on the heuristic H. We show that the critical behaviour is determined by the UP rule only. In the case where only constraints with 2 and 3 variables are present, we give the phase diagram and identify two universality classes: the power law class, where Psuccess[alpha\_H (1+epsilon N^{-1/3}), N] ~ A(epsilon)/N^gamma; the stretched exponential class, where Psuccess[alpha\_H (1+epsilon N^{-1/3}), N] ~ exp[-N^{1/6} Phi(epsilon)]. Which class is selected depends on the characteristic parameters of input data. The critical exponent gamma is universal and calculated; the scaling functions A and Phi weakly depend on the heuristic H and are obtained from the solutions of reaction-diffusion equations for 1-clauses. Computation of some non-universal corrections allows us to match numerical results with good precision. The critical behaviour for constraints with >3 variables is given.

The proposed deep-learning method of low-frequency extrapolation shows adequate generalizability for the initialization step of EFWI. Numerical examples show that the neural network trained on several submodels of the Marmousi model is able to predict the low frequencies for the BP 2004 benchmark model. Additionally, the neural network can robustly process seismic data with uncertainties due to the existence of noise, poorly-known source wavelet, and different finite-difference scheme in the forward modeling operator. Finally, this approach is not subject to the structural limitations of other methods for bandwidth extension, and seems to offer a tantalizing solution to the problem of properly initializing FWI.",Extrapolated full waveform inversion with deep learning
259,5,1911.08784v1,"Reconstruction of seismic data with missing traces is a long-standing issue in seismic data processing. In recent years, rank reduction operations are being commonly utilized to overcome this problem, which require the rank of seismic data to be a prior. However, the rank of field data is unknown; usually it requires much time to manually adjust the rank and just obtain an approximated rank. Methods based on deep learning require very large datasets for training; however acquiring large datasets is difficult owing to physical or financial constraints in practice. Therefore, in this work, we developed a novel method based on unsupervised learning using the intrinsic properties of a convolutional neural network known as U-net, without training datasets. Only one undersampled seismic data was needed, and the deep seismic prior of input data could be exploited by the network itself, thus making the reconstruction convenient. Furthermore, this method can handle both irregular and regular seismic data. Synthetic and field data were tested to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm (DSPRecon algorithm); the advantages of using our method were evaluated by comparing it with the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method for irregular data reconstruction and de-aliased Cadzow method for regular data reconstruction. Experimental results showed that our method provided better reconstruction performance than the SSA or Cadzow methods. The recovered signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were 32.68 dB and 19.11 dB for the DSPRecon and SSA algorithms, respectively. Those for the DSPRecon and Cadzow methods were 35.91 dB and 15.32 dB, respectively.",Deep-seismic-prior-based reconstruction of seismic data using   convolutional neural networks

260,2,0705.3442v1,"The transverse motion inside a Stark decelerator plays a large role in the total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves distributed loss due to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while the second is a result of the rapid decrease of the molecular velocity within the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means for overcoming them. Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design, the quadrupole-guiding decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal couplings throughout the slowing process and also exhibits gain over normal deceleration to the lowest velocities.",Mitigation of loss within a molecular Stark decelerator

Since the initial kinetic energy of the supersonic SO_2 molecular beam is high, and the removed kinetic energy per stage is small, 326 deceleration stages are necessary to bring SO_2 to a complete standstill, significantly more than in other experiments. We show that in such a decelerator possible loss due to coupling between the motional degrees of freedom must be considered.

Applying alternating-gradient focusing, OH radicals in their low-field-seeking ${}^2\Pi_{3/2},v=0,J=3/2,f$ state have been decelerated from 345 m/s to 239 m/s, removing 50 % of the kinetic energy using only 27 deceleration stages. The alternating-gradient decelerator allows to independently control longitudinal and transverse manipulation of the molecules. Optimized high-voltage switching sequences for the alternating-gradient deceleration are applied, in order to adjust the dynamic focusing strength in every deceleration stage to the changing velocity over the deceleration process. In addition we have also decelerated OH radicals in their high-field-seeking ${}^2\Pi_{3/2},v=0,J=3/2,e$ state from 355 m/s to 316 m/s.

260,5,0807.4056v1,"With a Stark decelerator, beams of neutral polar molecules can be accelerated, guided at a constant velocity, or decelerated. The effectiveness of this process is determined by the 6D volume in phase space from which molecules are accepted by the Stark decelerator. Couplings between the longitudinal and transverse motion of the molecules in the decelerator can reduce this acceptance. These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator operates such that only every third electric field stage is used for deceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate stages. For many applications, the acceptance of a Stark decelerator in this so-called $s=3$ mode significantly exceeds that of a decelerator in the conventionally used ($s=1$) mode. This has been experimentally verified by passing a beam of OH radicals through a 2.6 meter long Stark decelerator. The experiments are in quantitative agreement with the results of trajectory calculations, and can qualitatively be explained with a simple model for the 6D acceptance. These results imply that the 6D acceptance of a Stark decelerator in the $s=3$ mode of operation approaches the optimum value, i.e. the value that is obtained when any couplings are neglected.",Operation of a Stark decelerator with optimum acceptance

Calculated (according Faraday Law) and experimental dependences of deposition rates of these metals on quantity of electricity passed at direct and pulse currents are presented. Galvanodynamic i - v dependences have been obtained at various current scanning rates. The smaller rate of deposition allows to decrease concentration limitations of electrode process and to obtain higher average thickness of metal deposits and higher filling degree.

Despite this progress, many questions still remain about the mechanisms and universal features of ionic transport in these systems. In this paper, we examine the use of nanopores to probe ion transport and to construct functional nanoscale devices. Specifically, we focus on the newly predicted phenomenon of quantized ionic conductance in nanopores as a function of the effective pore radius - a prediction that yields a particularly transparent way to probe the contribution of dehydration to ionic transport. We study the role of ionic species in the formation of hydration layers inside and outside of pores. We find that the ion type plays only a minor role in the radial positions of the predicted steps in the ion conductance. However, ions with higher valency form stronger hydration shells, and thus, provide even more pronounced, and therefore, more easily detected, drops in the ionic current. Measuring this phenomenon directly, or from the resulting noise, with synthetic nanopores would provide evidence of the deviation from macroscopic (continuum) dielectric behavior due to microscopic features at the nanoscale and may shed light on the behavior of ions in more complex biological channels.",Dehydration and ionic conductance quantization in nanopores

262,1,0707.4193v2,"In this paper, Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) is used to determine properties of the Jovian atmosphere that cannot otherwise be found. These properties include the potential vorticity of the GRS and its neighboring jet streams, the shear imposed on the GRS by the jet streams, and the vertical entropy gradient (i.e., Rossby deformation radius). The cloud cover of the GRS, which is often used to define the GRS's area and aspect ratio, is found to differ significantly from the region of the GRS's potential vorticity anomaly. The westward-going jet stream to the north of the GRS and the eastward-going jet stream to its south are each found to have a large potential vorticity ``jump''. The jumps have opposite sign and as a consequence of their interaction with the GRS, the shear imposed on the GRS is reduced. The east-west to north-south aspect ratio of the GRS's potential vorticity anomaly depends on the ratio of the imposed shear to the strength of the anomaly. The aspect ratio is found to be $\approx$2:1, but without the opposing jumps it would be much greater. The GRS's high-speed collar and quiescent interior require that the potential vorticity in the interior be approximately half that in the collar.

This flow consists of a sequence of narrow eastward and broad westward zonal jets with a staircase PV structure; the PV-steps are at the latitudes of the cores of the eastward jets. Numerically simulated solutions to the quasigeostrophic PV conservation equation in a perturbed PV-staircase flow are presented. These simulations reveal that both eastward and westward zonal jets serve as robust meridional transport barriers. The surprise is that westward jets, across which the background PV gradient vanishes, serve as robust transport barriers. A theoretical explanation of the underlying barrier mechanism is provided. It is argued that transport barriers near the cores of westward zonal jets, across which the background PV gradient is small, are found in Jupiter's midlatitude weather layer and in the Earth's summer hemisphere subtropical stratosphere.",Zonal Jets as Transport Barriers in Planetary Atmospheres

Results: In the case where the turbulence intensity in the vertical direction dominates, the vertical stress is always negative. This situation is expected to occur in stellar convection zones. The horizontal component of the stress is weaker and exhibits a maximum at latitude 30 degrees - regardless of how rapid the rotation is.

This gives rise to an ordinary 1+1 field theory above some energy scale and a low energy SYK-like behavior.

Numerical results, obtained by exact diagonalization, are in excellent agreement with the analytical spectral density even for relatively small $N \sim 8$. For $N \gg 1$ and not close to the edge of the spectrum, we find the macroscopic spectral density simplifies to $\rho(E) \sim \exp[2\arcsin^2(E/E_0)/\log \eta]$, where $\eta$ is the suppression factor of the contribution of intersecting Wick contractions relative to nested contractions. This spectral density reproduces the known result for the free energy in the large $q$ and $N$ limit. In the infrared region, where the SYK model is believed to have a gravity-dual, the spectral density is given by $\rho(E) \sim \sinh[2\pi \sqrt 2 \sqrt{(1-E/E_0)/(-\log \eta)}]$. It therefore has a square-root edge, as in random matrix ensembles, followed by an exponential growth, a distinctive feature of black holes and also of low energy nuclear excitations. Results for level-statistics in this region confirm the agreement with random matrix theory. Physically this is a signature that, for sufficiently long times, the SYK model and its gravity dual evolve to a fully ergodic state whose dynamics only depends on the global symmetry of the system. Our results strongly suggest that random matrix correlations are a universal feature of quantum black holes and that the SYK model, combined with holography, may be relevant to model certain aspects of the nuclear dynamics.",Analytical Spectral Density of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model at finite N

We consider in detail the quantum critical behavior of the transition of a two dimensional Fermi fluid to a nematic state which breaks spontaneously the rotational invariance of the Fermi liquid. We show that higher dimensional bosonization reproduces the quantum critical behavior expected from the Hertz-Millis analysis, and verify that this theory has dynamic critical exponent $z=3$. Going beyond this framework, we study the behavior of the fermion degrees of freedom directly, and show that at quantum criticality as well as in the the quantum nematic phase (except along a set of measure zero of symmetry-dictated directions) the quasi-particles of the normal Fermi liquid are generally wiped out. Instead, they exhibit short ranged spatial correlations that decay faster than any power-law, with the law $|x|^{-1} \exp(-\textrm{const.} |x|^{1/3})$ and we verify explicitely the vanishing of the fermion residue utilizing this expression. In contrast, the fermion auto-correlation function has the behavior $|t|^{-1} \exp(-{\rm const}. |t|^{-2/3})$. In this regime we also find that, at low frequency, the single-particle fermion density-of-states behaves as $N^*(\omega)=N^*(0)+ B \omega^{2/3} \log\omega +...$, where $N^*(0)$ is larger than the free Fermi value, N(0), and $B$ is a constant.

The theory describes, among other cases, a ferromagnetic quantum-critical point (QCP) and a QCP towards nematic ordering. We construct a controllable expansion at the QCP in two steps: we first create a new, non Fermi-liquid ``zero-order'' Eliashberg-type theory, and then demonstrate that the residual interaction effects are small. We prove that this approach is justified under two conditions: the interaction should be smaller than the fermionic bandwidth, and either the band mass $m_B$ should be much smaller than $m = p_F/v_F$, or the number of fermionic flavors $N$ should be large. For an SU(2) symmetric ferromagnetic QCP, we find that the Eliashberg theory itself includes a set of singular renormalizations which can be understood as a consequence of an effective long-range dynamic interaction between quasi-particles, generated by the Landau damping term. These singular renormalizations give rise to a negative non-analytic $q^{3/2}$ correction to the static spin susceptibility, and destroy a ferromagnetic QCP. We demonstrate that this effect can be understood in the framework of the $\phi^4$ theory of quantum criticality. We also show that the non-analytic $q^{3/2}$ correction to the bosonic propagator is specific to the SU(2) symmetric case.

Conventional scenarios for the QCP involving collective degrees of freedom are shown to have serious shortcomings. Working within the original Landau quasiparticle picture, we propose an alternative topological scenario for the QCP, in systems that obey standard Fermi liquid (FL) theory in advance of the QCP. Applying the technique of Poincar\'e mapping, we analyze the sequence of iterative maps generated by the Landau equation for the single-particle spectrum at zero temperature. It is demonstrated that the Fermi surface is subject to rearrangement beyond the QCP. If the sequence of maps converges, a multi-connected Fermi surface is formed. If it fails to converge, the Fermi surface swells into a volume that provides a measure of entropy associated with formation of an exceptional state of the system characterized by partial occupation of single-particle states and dispersion of their spectrum proportional to temperature. Based on this dual scenario, the thermodynamics of Fermi systems beyond the QCP exhibits striking departures from the predictions of standard FL theory.

These are strong-coupling problems with no expansion parameter other than the number of fermionic species, N. The two known limits, N >>1 and N=0 show qualitatively different behavior of the fermionic propagator G(\epsilon_k, \omega). In the first limit, G(\epsilon_k, \omega) has a pole at some \epsilon_k, in the other it is analytic. We analyze the crossover between the two limits. We show that the pole survives for all N, but at small N it only exists in a range O(N^2) near the mass shell. At larger distances from the mass shell, the system evolves and G(\epsilon_k, \omega) becomes regular.

An alternative scenario, in which the topology of the Fermi surface is altered at the QCP, is found to explain the non-Fermi-liquid thermodynamic behavior observed experimentally in Yb-based compounds close to the QCP.

This process introduces a soft mode in the system, converting a load-bearing structure into a hinged, kinematic mechanism. Further indentation leads to twinning wherein the parabolic crease bifurcates into two creases that move apart on either side of the line of symmetry.

However, previous demonstrations have been limited to proof-of-principle experiments or studies of fundamental laboratory science. Here we present the development of CE-DFCS towards an industrial application -- measuring impurities in arsine, an important process gas used in III-V semiconductor compound manufacturing. A strongly absorbing background gas with an extremely complex, congested, and broadband spectrum renders trace detection exceptionally difficult, but the capabilities of CE-DFCS overcome this challenge and make it possible to identify and quantify multiple spectral lines associated with water impurities. Further, frequency combs allow easy access to new spectral regions via efficient nonlinear optical processes.

Rapid decrease of the source-drain current of an operating device is observed upon exposure of the channel to the species generated by high-vacuum gauges. We attribute this effect to interaction of the organic surface with electrically neutral free radicals produced in the process of hydrocarbon cracking on hot filaments with a relatively low activation energy Ea ~ 2.5 eV (240 kJ/mol).

It is found that surface treatment using silanising agents like hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and octadecyltrichlorosi-lane (OTS) can increase the field-effect mobility by up to a factor of 50, reaching values in saturation of more than 4E-2 cm^2/Vs at room temperature. While there is a clear correlation between the obtained field-effect mobility and the contact angle of water on the treated substrates, X-ray diffraction and capacitance measurements on MIS diodes show that structural and electrical properties in the bulk of the P3HT films are not influenced by the surface treatment. On the other hand, thermal annealing is found to cause an increase of grain size, bulk relaxation frequency and thereby of the mobility perpendicular to the SiO2/P3HT interface, but has very little influence on the field-effect mobility. Temperature dependent investigations on MIS diodes and FETs show that the transport perpendicular to the substrate plane is thermally activated and can be described by hopping in a Gaussian density of states, whereas the field-effect mobility in the substrate plane is almost temperature independent over a wide range.

268,1,0910.2572v1,"We present a fast general-purpose algorithm for high-throughput clustering of data ""with a two dimensional organization"". The algorithm is designed to be implemented with FPGAs or custom electronics. The key feature is a processing time that scales linearly with the amount of data to be processed. This means that clustering can be performed in pipeline with the readout, without suffering from combinatorial delays due to looping multiple times through all the data. This feature makes this algorithm especially well suited for problems where the data has high density, e.g. in the case of tracking devices working under high-luminosity condition such as those of LHC or Super-LHC. The algorithm is organized in two steps: the first step (core) clusters the data; the second step analyzes each cluster of data to extract the desired information. The current algorithm is developed as a clustering device for modern high-energy physics pixel detectors. However, the algorithm has much broader field of applications. In fact, its core does not specifically rely on the kind of data or detector it is working for, while the second step can and should be tailored for a given application. Applications can thus be foreseen to other detectors and other scientific fields ranging from HEP calorimeters to medical imaging. An additional advantage of this two steps approach is that the typical clustering related calculations (second step) are separated from the combinatorial complications of clustering. This separation simplifies the design of the second step and it enables it to perform sophisticated calculations achieving online-quality in online applications. The algorithm is general purpose in the sense that only minimal assumptions on the kind of clustering to be performed are made.",A Fast General-Purpose Clustering Algorithm Based on FPGAs for   High-Throughput Data Processing

Here, we use point-contact spectroscopy to reveal the temperature dependence of the electronic states in SmB6. We demonstrate that SmB6 is a model Kondo insulator: below 100 K, the conductance spectra reflect the Kondo hybridization of Sm ions, but below ~ 30 K, signatures of inter-ion correlation effects clearly emerge.

The emitters are bright and stable over timescales of several months in ambient conditions. With substrate interactions eliminated, we study the spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics of the defects' optical emission, which offer several clues about their electronic and chemical structure. Analysis of the defects' spectra reveals similarities in vibronic coupling despite widely-varying fluorescence wavelengths, and a statistical analysis of their polarized emission patterns indicates a correlation between the optical dipole orientations of some defects and the primitive crystallographic axes of the single-crystal h-BN film. These measurements constrain possible defect models, and, moreover, suggest that several classes of emitters can exist simultaneously in free-standing h-BN, whether they be different defects, different charge states of the same defect, or the result of strong local perturbations.",Optical Signatures of Quantum Emitters in Suspended Hexagonal Boron   Nitride
274,5,1704.05154v2,"Artificial atomic systems in solids such as single photon emitters are becoming increasingly important building blocks in quantum information processing and scalable quantum nanophotonic networks. Here, we report on a controllable way to engineer emitters in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals using plasma processing. The method is robust, and yields a 7-fold increase in the density of emitters in hBN, which is promising for their deployment in practical devices. While as-fabricated emitters suffer from blinking and bleaching, a subsequent annealing step yields photo-stable emitters. The presented process is the first step towards controllable placement of quantum emitters in hBN for integrated on-chip quantum nanophotonics based on 2D materials.",Atomic Engineering of Single Photon Sources in 2D Boron Nitride Zai-Quan

Within the random matrix approach this kind of a fluctuation dissipation relation allows us to derive the explicit analytical expression for the joint distribution function of the real and imaginary parts of the local Green function for all symmetry classes as well as at an arbitrary degree of the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the system. The outstanding problem of the orthogonal symmetry is further reduced to simple quadratures.

275,2,0504150v1,"We propose a model to describe the statistical properties of wave scattering through a classically chaotic cavity in the presence of surface absorption. Experimentally, surface absorption could be realized by attaching an ""absorbing patch"" to the inner wall of the cavity. In our model, the cavity is connected to the outside by a waveguide with N open modes (or channels), while an experimental patch is simulated by an ""absorbing mirror"" attached to the inside wall of the cavity; the mirror, consisting of a waveguide that supports Na channels, with absorption inside and a perfectly reflecting wall at its end, is described by a subunitary scattering matrix Sa. The number of channels Na, as a measure of the geometric cross section of the mirror, and the lack of unitarity of Sa as a measure of absorption, are under our control: these parameters have an important physical significance for real experiments. The absorption strength in the cavity is quantified by the trace of the lack of unitarity. The statistical distribution of the resulting S matrix for N=1 open channel and only one absorbing channel, Na =1, is solved analytically for the orthogonal and unitary universality classes, and the results are compared with those arising from numerical simulations. The relation with other models existing in the literature, in some of which absorption has a volumetric character, is also studied.",Statistical wave scattering through classically chaotic cavities in the   presence of surface absorption
275,3,0504196v6,"In wave chaotic scattering, statistical fluctuations of the scattering matrix $S$ and the impedance matrix $Z$ depend both on universal properties and on nonuniversal details of how the scatterer is coupled to external channels. This paper considers the impedance and scattering variance ratios, $VR_z$ and $VR_s$, where $VR_z=Var[Z_{ij}]/\{Var[Z_{ii}]Var[Z_{jj}] \}^{1/2}$, $VR_s=Var[S_{ij}]/\{Var[S_{ii}]Var[S_{jj}] \}^{1/2}$, and $Var[.]$ denotes variance. $VR_z$ is shown to be a universal function of distributed losses within the scatterer. That is, $VR_z$ is independent of nonuniversal coupling details. This contrasts with $VR_s$ for which universality applies only in the large loss limit. Explicit results are given for $VR_z$ for time reversal symmetric and broken time reversal symmetric systems.

275,5,0508092v1,"We review properties of open chaotic mesoscopic systems with a finite Ehrenfest time tau_E. The Ehrenfest time separates a short-time regime of the quantum dynamics, where wave packets closely follow the deterministic classical motion, from a long-time regime of fully-developed wave chaos. For a vanishing Ehrenfest time the quantum systems display a degree of universality which is well described by random-matrix theory. In the semiclassical limit, tau_E becomes parametrically larger than the scattering time off the boundaries and the dwell time in the system. This results in the emergence of an increasing number of deterministic transport and escape modes, which induce strong deviations from random-matrix universality. We discuss these deviations for a variety of physical phenomena, including shot noise, conductance fluctuations, decay of quasibound states, and the mesoscopic proximity effect in Andreev billiards.",Quantum-to-classical correspondence in open chaotic systems
276,1,0702034v1,"The flow of fluids in channels, pipes or ducts, as in any other wall-bounded flow (like water along the hulls of ships or air on airplanes) is hindered by a drag, which increases many-folds when the fluid flow turns from laminar to turbulent. A major technological problem is how to reduce this drag in order to minimize the expense of transporting fluids like oil in pipelines, or to move ships in the ocean. It was discovered in the mid-twentieth century that minute concentrations of polymers can reduce the drag in turbulent flows by up to 80%. While experimental knowledge had accumulated over the years, the fundamental theory of drag reduction by polymers remained elusive for a long time, with arguments raging whether this is a ""skin"" or a ""bulk"" effect. In this colloquium review we first summarize the phenomenology of drag reduction by polymers, stressing both its universal and non-universal aspects, and then proceed to review a recent theory that provides a quantitative explanation of all the known phenomenology. We treat both flexible and rod-like polymers, explaining the existence of universal properties like the Maximum Drag Reduction (MDR) asymptote, as well as non-universal cross-over phenomena that depend on the Reynolds number, on the nature of the polymer and on its concentration. Finally we also discuss other agents for drag reduction with a stress on the important example of bubbles.",Colloquium: Theory of Drag Reduction by Polymers in Wall Bounded   Turbulence

Rather long ago it was understood that this effect is related to supramolecular structures formed in the flow. Recent experiments by S. Chu, E.S.G. Shaqfeh and their associates, where the motion of supramolecular structures was directly observed, made it possible to understand and quantify the dynamic interaction of the polymeric structures with the solvent (water) flow.

276,4,0810.2815v2,"Nonmodal amplification of stochastic disturbances in elasticity-dominated channel flows of Oldroyd-B fluids is analyzed in this work. For streamwise-constant flows with high elasticity numbers $\mu$ and finite Weissenberg numbers $We$, we show that the linearized dynamics can be decomposed into slow and fast subsystems, and establish analytically that the steady-state variances of velocity and polymer stress fluctuations scale as $O (We^2)$ and $O (We^4)$, respectively. This demonstrates that large velocity variance can be sustained even in weakly inertial stochastically driven channel flows of viscoelastic fluids. We further show that the wall-normal and spanwise forces have the strongest impact on the flow fluctuations, and that the influence of these forces is largest on the fluctuations in streamwise velocity and the streamwise component of the polymer stress tensor. The underlying physical mechanism involves polymer stretching that introduces a lift-up of flow fluctuations similar to vortex tilting in inertia-dominated flows. The validity of our analytical results is confirmed in stochastic simulations. The phenomenon examined here provides a possible route for the early stages of a bypass transition to elastic turbulence and might be exploited to enhance mixing in microfluidic devices.",Nonmodal amplification of stochastic disturbances in strongly elastic   channel flows

In this paper, a bridge between polymer physics, self-avoiding walk and random vortex stretching is established which may help in getting a new insight on this topics. Actually a very simple relationship between stability index of the stable law and the well known Flory exponent stemming from polymer physics is established. Moreover the scaling of turbulence intermittencies with Reynolds number is also obtained and the overall picture is very close to Tennekes' simple model for the fine scale structure of turbulence [Phys.

We identify relevant hyperbolic trajectories and their manifolds, and show that the transport mechanism known as the `turnstile', previously identified in abstract dynamical systems and simplified model flows, is also at work in this complex and rather realistic ocean flow. In addition nonlinear dynamics techniques are shown to be powerful enough to identify the key geometric structures in this part of the Mediterranean. In particular the North Balearic Front, the westernmost part of the transition zone between saltier and fresher waters in the Western Mediterranean is interpreted in terms of the presence of a semipermanent ``Lagrangian barrier'' across which little transport occurs. Our construction also reveals the routes along which this transport happens. Topological changes in that picture, associated with the crossing by eddies and that may be interpreted as the breakdown of the front, are also observed during the simulation.",Lagrangian transport through an ocean front in the North-Western   Mediterranean Sea

However, a more detailed analysis of regional dependence and seasonal variability was still lacking. In this paper, we analyze the near-surface velocity field obtained from the Ocean general circulation model For the Earth Simulator (OFES) using Finite-Size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLE). We have characterized regional and seasonal variability. Our results show that horizontal stirring, as measured by FSLEs, is seasonally-varying, with maximum values in Summer time. FSLEs also strongly vary depending on the region: we have first characterized the stirring properties of Northern and Southern Hemispheres, then the main oceanic basins and currents. We have finally studied the relation between averages of FSLE and some Eulerian descriptors such as Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) and vorticity (w) over the different regions.",Seasonal and regional characterization of horizontal stirring in the   global ocean

The treatment of an arbitrary tracer, rather than only buoyancy, is necessary since OGCMs time step T, S, CO2, etc and not buoyancy. The particular case of buoyancy is used to assess the model results. The paper contains three parts: derivation of the results, discussion of the results and assessment of the latter using, among others, WOCE, T/P and Drifter data. Derivation. To construct the M fluxes, we first solve the ML M dynamic equations for the velocity and tracer M fields. The goal of the derivation is to emphasize the different treatments of the non-linear terms in the adiabatic vs. diabatic ocean (deep ocean vs. mixed layer). Results. We derive analytic expressions for the following variables: a) vertical and horizontal M fluxes of an arbitrary tracer, b) M diffusivity in terms of the EKE, c) surface value of the EKE in terms of the vertical M buoyancy flux together with a model for the z-profile of the M EKE, d) tapering function T(z) in terms of the large scale variables; vanishes at the surface and tends to unity below the ML where the stream function smoothly connects with the deep ocean GM form, e) new eddy induced velocity.

277,4,1108.1256v2,"Subsurface float and moored observations are presented to show for the first time the formation and propagation of anticyclonic submesoscale coherent vortices that transport relatively cold, fresh subpolar water to the interior subtropical North Atlantic. Acoustically tracked RAFOS floats released in the southward-flowing Western Boundary Current at the exit of the Labrador Sea reveal the formation of three of these eddies at the southern tip of the Grand Banks (42 N, 50 W). Using a recently developed method to detect eddies in float trajectories and estimate their kinematic properties, it was found that the eddies had average rotation periods of 5--7 days at radii of 1025 km, with mean rotation speeds of up to 0.3 m/s. One especially long-lived (5.1 months) eddy crossed under the Gulf Stream path and translated southwestward in the subtropical recirculation to at least 35 N, where it hit one of the Corner Rise Seamounts. Velocity, temperature and salinity measurements from a nine-month deployment of two moorings south of the Gulf Stream at 38 N, 50 W reveal the passage of at least two eddies with similar hydrographic and kinematic properties. The core temperature and salinity properties of the eddies imply their formation at intermediate levels of the Labrador Current south of the Tail of the Grand Banks. These observations confirm earlier speculation that eddies form in this region and transport anomalously cold, low-salinity water directly into the subtropical interior. Possible formation mechanisms and potential importance of these eddies to interior ventilation and the equatorward spreading of Labrador Sea Water are discussed.",Direct observations of formation and propagation of subpolar eddies into   the subtropical North Atlantic
277,5,1206.4468v1,"Recent studies indicate that altimetric observations of the ocean's mesoscale eddy field reflect the combined influence of surface buoyancy and interior potential vorticity anomalies. The former have a surface-trapped structure, while the latter have a more grave form. To assess the relative importance of each contribution to the signal, it is useful to project the observed field onto a set of modes that separates their influence in a natural way. However, the surface-trapped dynamics are not well-represented by standard baroclinic modes; moreover, they are dependent on horizontal scale.   Here we derive a modal decomposition that results from the simultaneous diagonalization of the energy and a generalisation of potential enstrophy that includes contributions from the surface buoyancy fields. This approach yields a family of orthonomal bases that depend on two parameters: the standard baroclinic modes are recovered in a limiting case, while other choices provide modes that represent surface and interior dynamics in an efficient way.   For constant stratification, these modes consist of symmetric and antisymmetric exponential modes that capture the surface dynamics, and a series of oscillating modes that represent the interior dynamics. Motivated by the ocean, where shears are concentrated near the upper surface, we also consider the special case of a quiescent lower surface. In this case, the interior modes are independent of wavenumber, and there is a single exponential surface mode that replaces the barotropic mode. We demonstrate the use and effectiveness of these modes by projecting the energy in a set of simulations of baroclinic turbulence.",A surface-aware projection basis for quasigeostrophic flow

279,1,1002.2250v1,"Most wind farms consist of horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) due to the high power coefficient (mechanical power output divided by the power of the free-stream air through the turbine cross-sectional area) of an isolated turbine. However when in close proximity to neighbouring turbines, HAWTs suffer from a reduced power coefficient. In contrast, previous research on vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) suggests that closely-spaced VAWTs may experience only small decreases (or even increases) in an individual turbine's power coefficient when placed in close proximity to neighbours, thus yielding much higher power outputs for a given area of land. A potential flow model of inter-VAWT interactions is developed to investigate the effect of changes in VAWT spatial arrangement on the array performance coefficient, which compares the expected average power coefficient of turbines in an array to a spatially-isolated turbine. A geometric arrangement based on the configuration of shed vortices in the wake of schooling fish is shown to significantly increase the array performance coefficient based upon an array of 16x16 wind turbines. Results suggest increases in power output of over one order of magnitude for a given area of land as compared to HAWTs.",Fish schooling as a basis for vertical axis wind turbine farm design
279,2,1010.3656v3,"Modern wind farms comprised of horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) require significant land resources to separate each wind turbine from the adjacent turbine wakes. This aerodynamic constraint limits the amount of power that can be extracted from a given wind farm footprint. The resulting inefficiency of HAWT farms is currently compensated by using taller wind turbines to access greater wind resources at high altitudes, but this solution comes at the expense of higher engineering costs and greater visual, acoustic, radar and environmental impacts. We investigated the use of counter-rotating vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in order to achieve higher power output per unit land area than existing wind farms consisting of HAWTs. Full-scale field tests of 10-m tall VAWTs in various counter-rotating configurations were conducted under natural wind conditions during summer 2010. Whereas modern wind farms consisting of HAWTs produce 2 to 3 watts of power per square meter of land area, these field tests indicate that power densities an order of magnitude greater can potentially be achieved by arranging VAWTs in layouts that enable them to extract energy from adjacent wakes and from above the wind farm. Moreover, this improved performance does not require higher individual wind turbine efficiency, only closer wind turbine spacing and a sufficient vertical flux of turbulence kinetic energy from the atmospheric surface layer. The results suggest an alternative approach to wind farming that has the potential to concurrently reduce the cost, size, and environmental impacts of wind farms.",Potential order-of-magnitude enhancement of wind farm power density via   counter-rotating vertical-axis wind turbine arrays

Various wind farms with fixed stream-wise spacing (7.85 rotor diameters) and varying lateral displacements and span-wise turbine spacings are considered, for a fixed inflow direction. Simulations show that, contrary to common belief, a perfectly staggered (checker-board) configuration does not necessarily give the highest average power output. Instead, the highest mean wind farm power output is found to depend on several factors, the most important one being the alignment that leads to minimization of wake effects from turbines in several upstream rows. This alignment typically occurs at significantly smaller angles than those corresponding to perfect staggering. The observed trends have implications for wind farm designs, especially in sites with a well-defined prevailing wind direction.",Large Eddy Simulation studies of the effects of alignment and wind farm   length
279,4,1408.1730v2,"We present and test the coupled wake boundary layer (CWBL) model that describes the distribution of the power output in a wind-farm. The model couples the traditional, industry-standard wake model approach with a ""top-down"" model for the overall wind-farm boundary layer structure. This wake model captures the effect of turbine positioning, while the ""top-down"" portion of the model adds the interactions between the wind-turbine wakes and the atmospheric boundary layer. Each portion of the model requires specification of a parameter that is not known a-priori. For the wake model, the wake expansion coefficient is required, while the ""top-down"" model requires an effective spanwise turbine spacing within which the model's momentum balance is relevant. The wake expansion coefficient is obtained by matching the predicted mean velocity at the turbine from both approaches, while the effective spanwise turbine spacing depends on turbine positioning and thus can be determined from the wake model. Coupling of the constitutive components of the CWBL model is achieved by iterating these parameters until convergence is reached. We illustrate the performance of the model by applying it to both developing wind-farms including entrance effects and to fully developed (deep-array) conditions. Comparisons of the CWBL model predictions with results from a suite of large eddy simulations (LES) shows that the model closely represents the results obtained in these high-fidelity numerical simulations.

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of yawing depends not only on the degree of wake deflection but also on the resulting shape of the wake. In this work, the deflection and morphology of wakes behind a wind turbine operating in yawed conditions are studied using wind tunnel experiments of a wind turbine modeled as a porous disk in a uniform inflow. First, by measuring velocity distributions at various downstream positions and comparing with prior studies, we confirm that the non-rotating wind turbine model in yaw generates realistic wake deflections. Second, we characterize the wake shape and make first observations of what is termed a curled wake, displaying significant spanwise asymmetry. The wake curling observed in the experiments is also reproduced qualitatively in large eddy simulations using both actuator disk and actuator line models. When a wind turbine is yawed for the benefit of downstream turbines, the asymmetric shape of the wake must be taken into account since it affects how much of it intersects the downstream turbines.",Wake Structure of Wind Turbines in Yaw under Uniform Inflow Conditions
280,1,1206.0400v1,"The concept of ""broken symmetry"", that the symmetry of the vacuum may be lower than the Hamiltonian of a quantum theory, plays an important role in modern physics. A manifestation of this phenomena is the Higgs boson in particle physics whose long awaited discovery is imminent. An equivalent mode in superconductors is implicit in the early theories of their collective fluctuations. Spurred by some mysterious experimental results, the theory of the oscillation of the amplitude of superconductivity order parameter, which is the equivalent to the Higgs modes in s-wave superconductors and its identification in the experiments, was explicitly provided. It was also shown that a necessary condition for this to occur is the emergent Lorentz invariance in the superconducting state while the metallic state and the region just below $T_c$ is manifestly non-Lorentz invariant. Here we show that d-wave superconductors, such as the high temperature Cuprate superconductors, should have a rich assortment of Higgs bosons, each in a different irreducible representation of the point-group symmetries of the lattice. We also show that these modes have a characteristic singular spectral structure which can be discovered in Raman scattering experiments.",Higgs Bosons in D-wave Superconductors
280,2,1404.2711v4,"A superconductor illuminated by an ac electric field with frequency $\Omega$ is theoretically found to generate a collective precession of Anderson's pseudospins, and hence a coherent amplitude oscillation of the order parameter, with a doubled frequency $2\Omega$ through a nonlinear light-matter coupling. We provide a fundamental theory, based on the mean-field formalism, to show that the induced pseudospin precession resonates with the Higgs amplitude mode of the superconductor at $2\Omega=2\Delta$ with $2\Delta$ being the superconducting gap. The resonant precession is accompanied by a divergent enhancement of the third-harmonic generation (THG). By decomposing the THG susceptibility into the bare one and vertex correction, we find that the enhancement of the THG cannot be explained by individual quasiparticle excitations (pair breaking), so that the THG serves as a smoking gun for an identification of the collective Higgs mode. We further explore the effect of electron-electron scattering on the pseudospin resonance by applying the nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the attractive Hubbard model driven by ac electric fields. The result indicates that the pseudospin resonance is robust against electron correlations, although the resonance width is broadened due to electron scattering, which determines the lifetime of the Higgs mode.",Theory of Anderson pseudospin resonance with Higgs mode in   superconductors
280,3,1406.2968v2,"The order parameter and its variations in space and time in many different states in condensed matter physics at low temperatures are described by the complex function $\Psi({\bf r}, t)$. These states include superfluids, superconductors, and a subclass of antiferromagnets and charge-density waves. The collective fluctuations in the ordered state may then be categorized as oscillations of phase and amplitude of $\Psi({\bf r}, t)$. The phase oscillations are the {\it Goldstone} modes of the broken continuous symmetry. The amplitude modes, even at long wavelengths, are well defined and decoupled from the phase oscillations only near particle-hole symmetry, where the equations of motion have an effective Lorentz symmetry as in particle physics, and if there are no significant avenues for decay into other excitations. They bear close correspondence with the so-called {\it Higgs} modes in particle physics, whose prediction and discovery is very important for the standard model of particle physics. In this review, we discuss the theory and the possible observation of the amplitude or Higgs modes in condensed matter physics -- in superconductors, cold-atoms in periodic lattices, and in uniaxial antiferromagnets. We discuss the necessity for at least approximate particle-hole symmetry as well as the special conditions required to couple to such modes because, being scalars, they do not couple linearly to the usual condensed matter probes.",Amplitude / Higgs Modes in Condensed Matter Physics
280,4,1412.0068v1,"The concept of mass-generation via the Higgs mechanism was strongly inspired by earlier works on the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in superconductors. In quantum field theory, the excitations of longitudinal components of the Higgs field manifest as massive Higgs bosons. The analogous Higgs mode in superconductors has not yet been observed due to its rapid decay into particle-hole pairs. Following recent theories, however, the Higgs mode should decrease below the pairing gap $2\Delta$ and become visible in two-dimensional systems close to the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT). For experimental verification, we measured the complex terahertz transmission and tunneling density of states (DOS) of various thin films of superconducting NbN and InO close to criticality. Comparing both techniques reveals a growing discrepancy between the finite $2\Delta$ and the threshold energy for electromagnetic absorption which vanishes critically towards the SIT.

Indeed, its resonance occurs at $2\Delta_0$, which coincides with the threshold $2E_{gap}$ for quasiparticle excitations, that spoil any relativistic dynamics. Here we investigate the fate of the Higgs mode in the unconventional case where $2E_{gap}$ becomes larger than $2\Delta_0$, as due to strong coupling or strong disorder. We show that also in this situation the amplitude fluctuations never identify a real mode at $2\Delta_0$, since such ""bosonic"" limit is always reached via a strong mixing with the phase fluctuations, which dominate the low-energy part of the spectrum. Our results have direct implications for the interpretation of the sub-gap optical absorption in disordered superconductors.",Non-relativistic dynamics of the amplitude (Higgs) mode in   superconductors
281,1,0503712v1,"In this paper, we have studied the effect of strain relaxation on magneto-transport properties of La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 epitaxial films (200 nm thick), which were deposited by pulsed laser deposition technique under identical conditions. All the films are epitaxial and have cubic unit cell. The amount of strain relaxation has been varied by taking three different single crystal substrates of SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO. It has been found that for thicker films the strain gets relaxed and produces variable amount of disorder depending on the strength of strain relaxation. The magnitude of lattice relaxation has been found to be 0.384, 3.057 and 6.411 percent for film deposited on SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO respectively. The films on LaAlO_3 and SrTiO_3 show higher T_{IM} of 243 K and 217 K respectively as compared to T_{IM} of 191 K for the film on MgO. Similarly T_C of the films on SrTiO_3 and LaAlO_3 is sharper and has value of 245 K and 220 K respectively whereas the TC of the film on MgO is 175 K. Higher degree of relaxation creates more defects and hence TIM (T_C) of the film on MgO is significantly lower than of SrTiO_3 and LaAlO_3. We have adopted a different approach to correlate the effect of strain relaxation on magneto-transport properties of LCMO films by evaluating the resistivity variation through Mott's VRH model. The variable presence of disorder in these thick films due to lattice relaxation which have been analyzed through Mott's VRH model provides a strong additional evidence that the strength of lattice relaxation produces disorder dominantly by increase in density of defects such as stacking faults, dislocations, etc. which affect the magneto-transport properties of thick epitaxial La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 films.",Effect of Strain Relaxation on Magnetotransport properties of epitaxial   La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 films

Based on early warning, provided by ground tracking and orbit prediction, it would be deployed a decade or more prior to a potential impact. Ion engines would be utilized for both the rendezvous with the asteroid and the towing phase. Since the GT does not dock with or otherwise physically contact the asteroid during the deflection process there is no requirement for knowledge of the asteroid's shape, composition, rotation state or other ""conventional"" characteristics. The GT would first reduce the uncertainty in the orbit of the asteroid via Earth tracking of its radio transponder while station keeping with the asteroid. If, after analysis of the more precise asteroid orbit a deflection is indeed indicated, the GT would ""hover"" above the surface of the asteroid in the direction of the required acceleration vector for a duration adequate to achieve the desired velocity change. The orbit of the asteroid is continuously monitored throughout the deflection process and the end state is known in real time.

282,2,1002.2277v1,"The density of orbital space debris constitutes an increasing environmental challenge. There are three ways to alleviate the problem: debris mitigation, debris removal and collision avoidance. This paper addresses collision avoidance, by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite increase in orbit prediction accuracy. Batch least-squares differential correction is applied to the publicly available two-line element (TLE) catalog of space objects. Using a high-precision numerical propagator, we fit an orbit to state vectors derived from successive TLEs. We then propagate the fitted orbit further forward in time. These predictions are compared to precision ephemeris data derived from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) for several satellites, including objects in the congested sun-synchronous orbital region. The method leads to a predicted range error that increases at a typical rate of 100 meters per day, approximately a 10-fold improvement over TLE's propagated with their associated analytic propagator (SGP4). Corresponding improvements for debris trajectories could potentially provide initial conjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable collision avoidance system.   We discuss additional optimization and the computational requirements for applying all-on-all conjunction analysis to the whole TLE catalog, present and near future. Finally, we outline a scheme for debris-debris collision avoidance that may become practicable given these developments.",Improved orbit predictions using two-line elements

The earliest of these was the PZT (piezoelectric lead zirconate tita-nate) sensor which was often used in-situ to measure the momentum of a particle at the time of impact. More recently, PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) [2] has been employed as it exhibits piezoelectric capabilities along with the advantages of ruggedness, no bias re-quirement, ease of large area sensor construction, high counting rate capability, and space reliability, making it an ideal space debris sensor.

282,4,1012.5232v1,"While building up a catalog of Earth orbiting objects, if the available optical observations are sparse, not deliberate follow ups of specific objects, no orbit determination is possible without previous correlation of observations obtained at different times. This correlation step is the most computationally intensive, and becomes more and more difficult as the number of objects to be discovered increases. In this paper we tested two different algorithms (and the related prototype software) recently developed to solve the correlation problem for objects in geostationary orbit (GEO), including the accurate orbit determination by full least squares solutions with all six orbital elements. Because of the presence in the GEO region of a significant subpopulation of high area to mass objects, strongly affected by non-gravitational perturbations, it was actually necessary to solve also for dynamical parameters describing these effects, that is to fit between 6 and 8 free parameters for each orbit. The validation was based upon a set of real data, acquired from the ESA Space Debris Telescope (ESASDT) at the Teide observatory (Canary Islands). We proved that it is possible to assemble a set of sparse observations into a set of objects with orbits, starting from a sparse time distribution of observations, which would be compatible with a survey capable of covering the region of interest in the sky just once per night. This could result in a significant reduction of the requirements for a future telescope network, with respect to what would have been required with the previously known algorithm for correlation and orbit determination.",Orbit determination of space objects based on sparse optical data

Four of the five methods rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to approximate important aspects of the brittle fracture problem. In addition to the ML algorithms, each method incorporates different physics-based assumptions in order to reduce the computational complexity while maintaining the physics as much as possible. This work specifically focuses on using the ML approaches to model a 2D concrete sample under low strain rate pure tensile loading conditions with 20 preexisting cracks present. A high-fidelity finite element-discrete element model is used to both produce a training dataset of 150 simulations and an additional 35 simulations for validation. Results from the ML approaches are directly compared against the results from the high-fidelity model. Strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed and the most important conclusion is that a combination of physics-informed and data-driven features are necessary for emulating the physics of crack propagation, interaction and coalescence.

We propose to use a collection of connected mechanistic building blocks with analytical homogenization solutions which avoids the loss of essential physics in generic neural networks, and this concept is demonstrated for 2-dimensional RVE problems and network depth up to 7. Based on linear elastic RVE data from offline direct numerical simulations, the material network can be effectively trained using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation algorithm, enhanced by model compression methods. Importantly, the trained network is valid for any local material laws without the need for additional calibration or micromechanics assumption. Its extrapolations to unknown material and loading spaces for a wide range of problems are validated through numerical experiments, including linear elasticity with high contrast of phase properties, nonlinear history-dependent plasticity and finite-strain hyperelasticity under large deformations.   By discovering a proper topological representation of RVE with fewer degrees of freedom, this intelligent material model is believed to open new possibilities of high-fidelity efficient concurrent simulations for a large-scale heterogeneous structure.

Our work uses deep neural network representations trained on data obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of martensitic phase transformations. The microscopic model leading to the microstructures is based on non-convex free energy density functions that give rise to martensitic variants, and must be extended to gradient theories of elasticity at finite strain. These strain gradients introduce interfacial energies as well as coercify the model, enabling the admission of a large number of solutions, each having finely laminated microstructures. The numerical stiffness of these DNS solutions and the fine scales of response make the data expensive to obtain, while also motivating the search for homogenized representations of their response for the purpose of engineering design. The high-dimensionality of the problem is reduced by training deep neural networks (DNNs) on the effective response by using the scalar free energy density data. The novelty in our approach is that the trained DNNs also return high-fidelity representations of derivative data, specifically the stresses. This allows the recapitulation of the classic hyperelastic response of continuum elasticity via the DNN representation.

The geometry and the total energy of shells are studied as a function of the elastic properties of the material they are made of. Particular emphasis is put on the buckling transition of the shells, that is a strong preference of the shell shapes to 'buckle out' in spatial regions close to the pentagonal disclinations for certain range of the elastic parameters of the problem. The transition effectively increases the mean square aspherity of shapes, making them look more like an icosahedron, rather than a sphere which is a preferred shape prior to the onset of the transition. The properties of the buckling transition are studied in cases when (i) the total volume enclosed by the elastic shell has to be fixed and when (ii) there is an internal pressure acting on the shell. This may be related to maturation process in non-enveloped dsDNA viruses, where the insertion of the genetic material in a pre-formed protein shell (viral coating) may effectively impose the fixed volume and/or pressure constraint.

Beams of xenon ions Xe$^{q+}$ with various charge states between $q$=2 and $q$=18 have been used at energies between 5 keV and 17.5 keV per charge generated by the ECRIS. The intensity of the beam was typically varied between 1 and 100 nA. Beams of highly charged residual gas ions have been produced by the EBIS at 4.5 keV per charge and with low intensities down to 100 pA. The scintillator materials used are flat screens of P46 YAG and P43 phosphor. In all cases, scintillation light emitted from the screen surface was detected by a CCD camera. The scintillation light intensity has been found to depend linearly on the kinetic ion energy per time deposited into the scintillator, while up to $q$=18 no significant contribution from the ions' potential energy was found.

We used the density matrix renormalization group algorithms in order to compute the stiffness, a measure that gives the magnitude of the persistent currents as a function of the boundary conditions for different sets of both interaction and disorder characteristics. In contrast to its non-interacting value, an increase in the stiffness parameter was observed for systems at and off half-filling for weak interactions and non-zero disorders. Within the strong interaction limit, the decrease in stiffness depends on the filling and an analytical approach is developed to recover the observed behaviors. This is required in order to understand its mechanisms. Finally, the study of the localization length confirms the enhancement of the persistent current for moderate interactions when disorders are present at half-filling.

Within the range of incident momentum for which the ring is transparent at zero magnetic field, the Lorentz force leads to a decrease of the oscillation amplitude, due to the asymmetry in the electron injection in the two arms of the ring. For structures in which the fast electrons are predominantly backscattered, the Lorentz force assists in the transport producing an initial increase of the corresponding oscillation amplitude. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of elastic scattering on a potential cavity within one of the arms of the ring.

The nature of the relaxation depends on the time regime (diffusive or ergodic) but also on the harmonics $n$ of the magnetoconductivity. Whereas phase coherence relaxation is non exponential for the harmonic $n=0$, it is always exponential for harmonics $n\neq0$.

All filtering levels make use of explicit filters applied in the physical space (on an element-by-element approach) and spectral (modal) spaces. The two subgrid-scales models are validated and compared to available experimental and numerical reference results, showing very good agreement. Specific features of lid-driven cavity flow in the turbulent regime, such as inhomogeneity of turbulence, turbulence production near the downstream corner eddy, small-scales localization and helical properties are investigated and discussed in the large-eddy simulation framework.

The Legendre spectral element method is used for the spatial discretization to solve the filtered Navier--Stokes equations. A novel variant of approximate deconvolution models blended with a mixed scale model using a dynamic evaluation of the subgrid-viscosity constant is proposed. This model is validated by comparing the large-eddy simulation with the direct numerical simulation of the flow in a lid-driven cubical cavity, performed at a Reynolds number of 12'000. Subgrid modeling in the case of a flow with coexisting laminar, transitional and turbulent zones such as the lid-driven cubical cavity flow represents a challenging problem. Moreover, the coupling with the spectral element method having very low numerical dissipation and dispersion builds a well suited framework to analyze the efficiency of a subgrid model. First- and second-order statistics obtained using this new model are showing very good agreement with the direct numerical simulation.

292,4,0901.0593v1,"In this paper, we discuss the incorporation of dynamic subgrid scale (SGS) models in the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows. The use of a dynamic procedure, which involves sampling or test-filtering of super-grid turbulence dynamics and subsequent use of scale-invariance for two levels, circumvents the need for empiricism in determining the magnitude of the model coefficient of the SGS models. We employ the multiple relaxation times (MRT) formulation of LBM with a forcing term for simulation of the grid-filtered dynamics of large-eddies. The dynamic procedure is illustrated for use with the common Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity SGS model. We also discuss proper sampling techniques or test-filters that facilitate implementation of dynamic models in the LBM. For accommodating variable resolutions, we employ locally refined grids in this framework. As examples, we consider the canonical fully developed turbulent channel flow at two different shear Reynolds numbers $Re_{*}$ of 180 and 395. The approach is able to automatically and self-consistently compute the values of the Smagorinsky coefficient, $C_S$. In particular, the computed value in the outer or bulk flow region, where turbulence is generally more isotropic, is about 0.155 (or the model coefficient $C=C_S^2=0.024$) which is in good agreement with prior data. The model coefficient is also found to become smaller and approaches towards zero near walls, reflecting the dampening of turbulent length scales near walls and the computed turbulence statistics are also in good agreement with prior data.

Secondly, it provides an explicit control on the statistical uncertainty of the drift and diffusion profiles. These features lend to the possibility of designing the external force driving the system so to maximize the accuracy of the drift and diffusions profile throughout the phase space of interest.

Its shape is in agreement with the universal form derived for soft oscillators interacting with sound waves. The excess vibrations forming the boson peak have mainly transverse character. From the dynamic structure factor in the Brillouin regime pseudo dispersion curves are calculated. Whereas the longitudinal phonons are well defined up to the pseudo zone boundary the transverse ones rapidly get over-damped and go through the Ioffe-Regel limit near the boson peak frequency. In the high $q$ regime constant-$\omega$ scans of the dynamic structure factor for frequencies around the boson peak are clearly distinct from those for zone boundary frequencies. Above the Brillouin regime, the scans for the low frequency modes follow closely the static structure factor. This still holds after a deconvolution of the exact harmonic eigenmodes into local and extended m odes.

However, in real glasses one expects that some molecules will be connected to their neighbors by more than one weak bond, so that a realistic model should consider oscillators with several weak springs. In this paper, a t-matrix formalism is used to study the effect of such correlated weak springs in a scalar model on a simple cubic lattice with a binary distribution of spring constants. Our results, which are confirmed by computer simulations, show that a concentration of c oscillators with z weak springs and 6-z strong ones leads to a low frequency peak in the reduced density of states (Boson peak) even when the total concentration of weak springs cz is less than 10%., No such peak has been found at these low concentrations in previously reported calculations which used effective medium methods.

We focus on recently investigated issues from inelastic-X-ray-scattering and computer-simulation studies for dynamic structure factors and longitudinal and transversal current spectra: the anomalous dispersion of the high-frequency sound velocity and the nature of the low-frequency excitation called the boson peak. It will be discussed how the sound mode interferes with other low-lying modes present in the system. Thereby, we provide a systematic explanation of the anomalous sound-velocity dispersion in systems -- ranging from high temperature liquid down to deep inside the glass state -- in terms of the contributions from the structural-relaxation processes and from vibrational excitations called the anomalous-oscillation peak (AOP). A possibility of observing negative dispersion -- the {\em decrease} of the sound velocity upon increase of the wave number -- is argued when the sound-velocity dispersion is dominated by the contribution from the vibrational dynamics. We also show that the low-frequency excitation, observable in both of the glass-state longitudinal and transversal current spectra at the same resonance frequency, is the manifestation of the AOP. As a consequence of the presence of the AOP in the transversal current spectra, it is predicted that the transversal sound velocity also exhibits the anomalous dispersion.

We have implemented this algorithm as an extension to the QPipeline, a gravitational-wave data analysis pipeline for the detection of bursts, which currently determines the statistical significance of events based solely on the peak significance observed in minimum uncertainty regions of the time-frequency plane. Density based clustering improves the performance of such a search by considering the aggregate significance of arbitrarily shaped regions in the time-frequency plane and rejecting the isolated minimum uncertainty features expected from the background detector noise.

The development of techniques that allow us to discriminate a signal of astrophysical origin from instrumental artefacts in the interferometer data and to extract the full range of information are some of the primary goals of the current work. Here we report the details of a Bayesian approach to the problem of inference for gravitational wave observations using a network of instruments, for the computation of the Bayes factor between two hypotheses and the evaluation of the marginalised posterior density functions of the unknown model parameters. The numerical algorithm to tackle the notoriously difficult problem of the evaluation of large multi-dimensional integrals is based on a technique known as Nested Sampling, which provides an attractive alternative to more traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We discuss the details of the implementation of this algorithm and its performance against a Gaussian model of the background noise, considering the specific case of the signal produced by the in-spiral of binary systems of black holes and/or neutron stars, although the method is completely general and can be applied to other classes of sources. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by introducing a new coherence test to distinguish between the presence of a coherent signal of astrophysical origin in the data of multiple instruments and the presence of incoherent accidental artefacts, and the effects on the estimation of the source parameters as a function of the number of instruments in the network.",Bayesian coherent analysis of in-spiral gravitational wave signals with   a detector network
297,4,0911.5051v2,"In signal detection problems, one is usually faced with the task of searching a parameter space for peaks in the likelihood function which indicate the presence of a signal. Random searches have proven to be very efficient as well as easy to implement, compared e.g. to searches along regular grids in parameter space. Knowledge of the parameterised shape of the signal searched for adds structure to the parameter space, i.e., there are usually regions requiring to be densely searched while in other regions a coarser search is sufficient. On the other hand, prior information identifies the regions in which a search will actually be promising or may likely be in vain. Defining specific figures of merit allows one to combine both template metric and prior distribution and devise optimal sampling schemes over the parameter space. We show an example related to the gravitational wave signal from a binary inspiral event. Here the template metric and prior information are particularly contradictory, since signals from low-mass systems tolerate the least mismatch in parameter space while high-mass systems are far more likely, as they imply a greater signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hence are detectable to greater distances.

298,1,1112.3387v1,"We assess how the propagation of high-frequency elastic-flexural waves through an ice shelf is modified by the presence of spatially periodic crevasses. Analysis of the normal modes supported by the ice shelf with and without crevasses reveals that a periodic crevasse distribution qualitatively changes the mechanical response. The normal modes of an ice shelf free of crevasses are evenly distributed as a function of frequency. In contrast, the normal modes of a crevasse-ridden ice shelf are distributed unevenly. There are ""band gaps"", frequency ranges over which no eigenmodes exist. A model ice shelf that is 50 km in lateral extent and 300 m thick with crevasses spaced 500 m apart has a band gap from 0.2 to 0.38 Hz. This is a frequency range relevant for ocean wave/ice-shelf interactions. When the outermost edge of the crevassed ice shelf is oscillated at a frequency within the band gap, the ice shelf responds very differently from a crevasse-free ice shelf. The flexural motion of the crevassed ice shelf is confined to a small region near the outermost edge of the ice shelf and effectively ""blocked"" from reaching the interior.",Blocking a wave: Frequency band gaps in ice shelves with periodic   crevasses
298,2,1203.2981v1,"A wave-ice interaction model for the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is reported, which involves both the attenuation of ocean surface waves by sea ice and the concomitant breaking of the ice by waves. It is specifically designed to embed wave-ice interactions in an operational ice/ocean model for the first time. We investigate different methods of including the wave forcing, and different criteria for determining if they cause floes to break. We also investigate and discuss the effects of using various attenuation models, finding that predicted MIZ widths are quite sensitive to the choice of model. Additional sensitivity tests are performed on: (i) different parameterizations of the floe size distribution (FSD), including the initial FSD used; (ii) the properties of the wave field; and (iii) the sea ice properties such as concentration, thickness and breaking strain. Results are relatively insensitive to FSD parameterization but vary noticeably and systematically with its initial configuration, as they do with properties (ii-iii). An additional, somewhat surprising sensitivity, is the degree of influence of the numerical scheme that performs wave attenuation and advection. This is because a naive implementation of spatial and temporal discretizations can cause the waves to be over-attenuated, leading to a reduction of the predicted MIZ width by a substantial factor. Example simulations intended to represent conditions in the Fram Strait in 2007, which exploit reanalyzed wave and ice model data, are shown to conclude the results section. These compare favorably to estimates of MIZ width using concentrations obtained from remotely-sensed passive microwave images.",Towards the inclusion of wave-ice interactions in large-scale models for   the Marginal Ice Zone

Using MRI velocimetry we show that the suspension has a yield stress. From classical rheology it follows that as a function of the applied stress the suspension is first solid (yield stress), then liquid and then solid again when it shear thickens. The onset shear rate for thickening is found to depend on the measurement geometry: the smaller the gap of the shear cell, the lower the shear rate at which thickening occurs. Shear thickening can then be interpreted as the consequence of the Reynolds dilatancy: the system under flow wants to dilate but instead undergoes a jamming transition because it is confined, as confirmed by measurement of the dilation of the suspension as a function of the shear rate.",Shear thickening of cornstarch suspensions as a re-entrant jamming   transition
299,2,0904.0671v1,We report on rheometry measurements to characterize critical behavior in two model shear thickening suspensions: cornstarch in water and glass spheres in oil. The slope of the shear thickening part of the viscosity curve is found to increase dramatically with packing fraction and diverge at a critical packing fraction phi_c. The magnitude of the viscosity and the yield stress are also found to have scalings that diverge at phi_c. We observe shear thickening as long as the yield stress is less than the stress at the viscosity maximum. Above this point the suspensions transition to purely shear thinning. Based on these data we present a dynamic jamming phase diagram for suspensions and show that a limiting case of shear thickening corresponds to a jammed state.,A dynamic jamming point for shear thickening suspensions
299,3,1106.6093v2,"We investigated the effects of particle shape on shear thickening in densely packed suspensions. Rods of different aspect ratios and non-convex hooked rods were fabricated. Viscosity curves and normal stresses were measured using a rheometer for a wide range of packing fractions for each shape. Suspensions of each shape exhibit qualitatively similar Discontinuous Shear Thickening. The logarithmic slope of the stress/shear-rate relation increases dramatically with packing fraction and diverges at a critical packing fraction phi_c which depends on particle shape. The packing fraction dependence of the viscosity curves for different convex shapes can be collapsed when the packing fraction is normalized by phi_c. Intriguingly, viscosity curves for non-convex particles do not collapse on the same set as convex particles, showing strong shear thickening over a wider range of packing fraction. The value of phi_c is found to coincide with the onset of a yield stress at the jamming transition, suggesting the jamming transition also controls shear thickening. The yield stress is found to correspond with trapped air in the suspensions, and the scale of the stress can be attributed to interfacial tension forces which dramatically increase above phi_c due to the geometric constraints of jamming. The relationship between shear and normal stresses is found to be linear in both the shear thickening and jammed regimes, indicating that the shear stresses come from friction. In the limit of zero shear rate, normal stresses pull the rheometer plates together due to the surface tension of the liquid below phi_c, but push the rheometer plates apart due to jamming above phi_c.",Shear thickening and jamming in densely packed suspensions of different   particle shapes
299,4,1112.1194v2,"The dynamical mechanisms controlling the rheology of dense suspensions close to jamming are investigated numerically, using simplified models for the relevant dissipative forces. We show that the velocity fluctuations control the dissipation rate and therefore the effective viscosity of the suspension. These fluctuations are similar in quasi-static simulations and for finite strain rate calculations with various damping schemes. We conclude that the statistical properties of grain trajectories -- in particular the critical exponent of velocity fluctuations with respect to volume fraction \phi -- only weakly depend on the dissipation mechanism. Rather they are determined by steric effects, which are the main driving forces in the quasistatic simulations. The critical exponent of the suspension viscosity with respect to \phi can then be deduced, and is consistent with experimental data.",Shear flow of non-Brownian suspensions close to jamming
299,5,1206.1717v1,"We study the rheology of cornstarch suspensions, a non-Brownian particle system that exhibits discontinuous shear thickening. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the local properties of the flow are obtained by the determination of local velocity profiles and concentrations in a Couette cell. For low rotational rates, we observe shear localization characteristic of yield stress fluids. When the overall shear rate is increased, the width of the sheared region increases. The discontinuous shear thickening is found to set in at the end of this shear localization regime when all of the fluid is sheared: the existence of a nonflowing region, thus, seems to prevent or delay shear thickening. Macroscopic observations using different measurement geometries show that the smaller the gap of the shear cell, the lower the shear rate at which shear thickening sets in. We, thus, propose that the discontinuous shear thickening of cornstarch suspensions is a consequence of dilatancy: the system under flow attempts to dilate but instead undergoes a jamming transition, because it is confined. This proposition is confirmed by an independent measurement of the dilation of the suspension as a function of the shear rate. It is also explains the MRI observations: when flow is localized, the nonflowing region plays the role of a ""dilatancy reservoir"" which allows the material to be sheared without jamming.",Shear thickening of cornstarch suspensions

We find that the equation's parameters are time-dependent. This time-dependence is rarely accounted for, and invalidates Lindblad's dynamical semigroup analysis. We analyze one such Bloch-Redfield master equation (for a two-level system coupled to an environment with a short but non-vanishing memory time), which apparently violates positivity.

For phonon baths however, the secular approximation is expected to be invalid. The usual Markovian master equation does not generally preserve positivity of the density matrix. As a solution we propose a coarse-graining approach with a dynamically adapted coarse graining time scale. For some simple examples we demonstrate that this preserves the accuracy of the integro-differential Born equation. For large times we analytically show that the secular approximation master equation is recovered.

The oxidation was performed in the temperature range 1000C to 1200C for samples with nitrogen doping in the range of 6.5e15/cm3 to 9.3e18/cm3, showing a clear doping dependence. Samples with higher doping concentrations displayed higher oxidation rates. The results were interpreted using a modified Deal-Grove model. Linear and parabolic rate constants and activation energies were extracted. Increasing nitrogen led to an increase in linear rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10-6m/s to 10-2m/s and the parabolic rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10e9m2/s to 10e6m2/s. The increase in linear rate constant was attributed to defects from doping-induced lattice mismatch, which tend to be more reactive than bulk crystal regions. The increase in the diffusion-limited parabolic rate constant was attributed to degradation in oxide quality originating from the doping-induced lattice mismatch. This degradation was confirmed by the observation of a decrease in optical density of the grown oxide films from 1.4 to 1.24. The linear activation energy varied from 1.6eV to 2.8eV, while the parabolic activation energy varied from 2.7eV to 3.3eV, increasing with doping concentration. These increased activation energies were attributed to higher nitrogen content, leading to an increase in effective bond energy stemming from the difference in C-Si (2.82eV) and Si-N (4.26eV) binding energies.

The objective of this paper is to explore the possibility of a hardware neural network (HNN) implementation using a spin switch (SS) as its basic building block. SS is a recently proposed device based on established technology with a transistor-like gain and input-output isolation. This allows neural networks to be constructed with purely passive interconnections without intervening clocks or amplifiers. The weights for the neural network are conveniently adjusted through analog voltages that can be stored in a non-volatile manner in an underlying CMOS layer using a floating gate low dropout voltage regulator.

We show that equipping such a system with continuous learning enables it to recover from the loss of neurons and makes it possible to use unreliable synaptic weights (i.e. low energy barrier magnetic memories). There is a tradeoff between power consumption and precision because low energy barrier memories consume less energy than high barrier ones.

GPE is a nonlinear Schroedinger equation which describes the order parameter of such systems at the mean field level. In the present work, we describe a Fortran 90 computer program developed by us, which solves the GPE using a basis set expansion technique. In this technique, the condensate wave function (order parameter) is expanded in terms of the solutions of the simple-harmonic oscillator (SHO) characterizing the atomic trap. Additionally, the same approach is also used to solve the problems in which the trap is weakly anharmonic, and the anharmonic potential can be expressed as a polynomial in the position operators x, y, and z. The resulting eigenvalue problem is solved iteratively using either the self-consistent-field (SCF) approach, or the imaginary time steepest-descent (SD) approach. Our results for harmonic traps are also compared with those published by other authors using different numerical approaches, and excellent agreement is obtained. GPE is also solved for a few anharmonic potentials, and the influence of anharmonicity on the condensate is discussed.

305,1,0601715v1,"We propose to extend the well-known MUSCL-Hancock scheme for Euler equations to the induction equation modeling the magnetic field evolution in kinematic dynamo problems. The scheme is based on an integral form of the underlying conservation law which, in our formulation, results in a ``finite-surface'' scheme for the induction equation. This naturally leads to the well-known ``constrained transport'' method, with additional continuity requirement on the magnetic field representation. The second ingredient in the MUSCL scheme is the predictor step that ensures second order accuracy both in space and time. We explore specific constraints that the mathematical properties of the induction equations place on this predictor step, showing that three possible variants can be considered. We show that the most aggressive formulations (referred to as C-MUSCL and U-MUSCL) reach the same level of accuracy as the other one (referred to as Runge-Kutta), at a lower computational cost. More interestingly, these two schemes are compatible with the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) framework. It has been implemented in the AMR code RAMSES. It offers a novel and efficient implementation of a second order scheme for the induction equation. We have tested it by solving two kinematic dynamo problems in the low diffusion limit.

Second order accurate divergence-free schemes for MHD have shown themselves to be very useful in several areas of science and engineering. However, certain computational MHD problems would be much benefited if the schemes had third and higher orders of accuracy. In this paper we show that the reconstruction of divergence-free vector fields can be carried out with better than second order accuracy. As a result, we design divergence-free weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes for MHD that have order of accuracy better than second. A multistage Runge-Kutta time integration is used to ensure that the temporal accuracy matches the spatial accuracy.

Closed form expressions for the resolved fluxes are also provided to facilitate numerical implementation. The Riemann solver is proved to be positively conservative for the density variable; the positivity of the pressure variable has been demonstrated for Euler flows when the divergence in the fluid velocities is suitably restricted so as to prevent the formation of cavitation in the flow.   We also focus on the construction of multidimensionally upwinded electric fields for divergence-free magnetohydrodynamical flows. A robust and efficient second order accurate numerical scheme for two and three dimensional Euler and magnetohydrodynamic flows is presented.

A uniformly-rotating region forms near the outer cylinder. A strong magnetic field leads to a steady Stewartson layer emanating from the junction between differentially rotating rings at the endcaps. The Stewartson layer becomes thinner with larger Reynolds number and penetrates deeper into the bulk flow with stronger magnetic field and larger Reynolds number. However, at Reynolds number larger than a critical value $\sim 600$, axisymmetric, and perhaps also nonaxisymmetric, instabilities occur and result in a less prominent Stewartson layer that extends less far from the boundary.",Magnetized Ekman Layer and Stewartson Layer in a Magnetized   Taylor-Couette Flow

We first confirm that the Squire transformation for MHD is compatible with the stress and insulating boundary conditions at the free surface, but argue that unless the flow is driven at fixed Galilei and capillary numbers, the critical mode is not necessarily two-dimensional. We then investigate numerically how a flow-normal magnetic field, and the associated Hartmann steady state, affect the soft and hard instability modes of free surface flow, working in the low magnetic Prandtl number regime of laboratory fluids. Because it is a critical layer instability, the hard mode is found to exhibit similar behaviour to the even unstable mode in channel Hartmann flow, in terms of both the weak influence of Pm on its neutral stability curve, and the dependence of its critical Reynolds number Re_c on the Hartmann number Ha. In contrast, the structure of the soft mode's growth rate contours in the (Re, alpha) plane, where alpha is the wavenumber, differs markedly between problems with small, but nonzero, Pm, and their counterparts in the inductionless limit. As derived from large wavelength approximations, and confirmed numerically, the soft mode's critical Reynolds number grows exponentially with Ha in inductionless problems. However, when Pm is nonzero the Lorentz force originating from the steady state current leads to a modification of Re_c(Ha) to either a sublinearly increasing, or decreasing function of Ha, respectively for problems with insulating and conducting walls. In the former, we also observe pairs of Alfven waves, the upstream propagating wave undergoing an instability at large Alfven numbers.",Large-wavelength instabilities in free-surface Hartmann flow at low   magnetic Prandtl numbers

The two systems are similar in terms of structure and molecular weight but have different electrostatic charges. The neutron scattering data have been interpreted in terms of a model that assumes the formation of mixed polymer-surfactant aggregates, also called colloidal complexes. These complexes exhibit a core-shell microstructure, where the core is a dense coacervate microphase of micelles surrounded by neutral blocks. Here, we are taking advantage of the fact that the complexation results in finite-size aggregates to shed some light on the complexation mechanisms. In order to analyze quantitatively the neutron data, we develop two different approaches to derive the number of surfactant micelles per polymer in the mixed aggregates and the distributions of aggregation numbers. With these results, we show that the formation of the colloidal complex is in agreement with the overcharging predictions. In both systems, the amount of polyelectrolytes needed to build the core-shell colloids always exceeds the number that would be necessary to compensate the charge of the micelles.

308,1,1112.0258v1,"We propose to measure nonadiabaticity of molecular quantum dynamics rigorously with the quantum fidelity between the Born-Oppenheimer and fully nonadiabatic dynamics. It is shown that this measure of nonadiabaticity applies in situations where other criteria, such as the energy gap criterion or the extent of population transfer, fail. We further propose to estimate this quantum fidelity efficiently with a generalization of the dephasing representation to multiple surfaces. Two variants of the multiple-surface dephasing representation (MSDR) are introduced, in which the nuclei are propagated either with the fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) or with the locally mean field dynamics (LMFD). The LMFD can be interpreted as the Ehrenfest dynamics of an ensemble of nuclear trajectories, and has been used previously in the nonadiabatic semiclassical initial value representation. In addition to propagating an ensemble of classical trajectories, the MSDR requires evaluating nonadiabatic couplings and solving the Schr\""{o}dinger (or more generally, the quantum Liouville-von Neumann) equation for a single discrete degree of freedom. The MSDR can be also used to measure the importance of other terms present in the molecular Hamiltonian, such as diabatic couplings, spin-orbit couplings, or couplings to external fields, and to evaluate the accuracy of quantum dynamics with an approximate nonadiabatic Hamiltonian. The method is tested on three model problems introduced by Tully, on a two-surface model of dissociation of NaI, and a three-surface model including spin-orbit interactions.

310,1,0510171v2,"Local field potentials (LFPs) are routinely measured experimentally in brain tissue, and exhibit strong low-pass frequency filtering properties, with high frequencies (such as action potentials) being visible only at very short distances ($\approx$10~$\mu m$) from the recording electrode. Understanding this filtering is crucial to relate LFP signals with neuronal activity, but not much is known about the exact mechanisms underlying this low-pass filtering. In this paper, we investigate a possible biophysical mechanism for the low-pass filtering properties of LFPs. We investigate the propagation of electric fields and its frequency dependence close to the current source, i.e. at length scales in the order of average interneuronal distance. We take into account the presence of a high density of cellular membranes around current sources, such as glial cells. By considering them as passive cells, we show that under the influence of the electric source field, they respond by polarisation, i.e., creation of an induced field. Because of the finite velocity of ionic charge movement, this polarization will not be instantaneous. Consequently, the induced electric field will be frequency-dependent, and much reduced for high frequencies. Our model establishes that with respect to frequency attenuation properties, this situation is analogous to an equivalent RC-circuit, or better a system of coupled RC-circuits. We present a number of numerical simulations of induced electric field for biologically realistic values of parameters, and show this frequency filtering effect as well as the attenuation of extracellular potentials with distance.

Interestingly, the suggested entanglement term can also slow down action potential initiation.",Quantum entanglement in the voltage dependent sodium channel can   reproduce the salient features of neuronal action potential initiation
310,4,0905.1683v2,"We suggest that the propagation of the action potential is driven by a pressure pulse propagating in the axoplasm along the axon length. The pressure pulse mechanically activates Na ion channels embedded in the axon membrane. This activation initiates the development of a local membrane voltage spike, as in the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential. Extracellular Ca ions influxing during the voltage spike trigger a mechanism that amplifies the pressure pulse and therefore prevents its viscous decay. The model is able to explain a number of phenomena that are unexplained within the Hodgkin-Huxley framework: the Meyer-Overton rule for the effectiveness of anesthetics, as well as various mechanical, optical and thermodynamic phenomena accompanying the action potential. The model correctly predicts the velocity of propagation of the nerve impulse, including its dependence on axon diameter, degree of myelination and temperature.",Action potential as a pressure pulse propagating in the axoplasm
310,5,1006.3281v1,"Close to melting transitions it is possible to propagate solitary electromechanical pulses which reflect many of the experimental features of the nerve pulse including mechanical dislocations and reversible heat production. Here we show that one also obtains the possibility of periodic pulse generation when the boundary condition for the nerve is the conservation of the overall length of the nerve. This condition generates an undershoot beneath the baseline (`hyperpolarization') and a `refractory period', i.e., a minimum distance between pulses. In this paper, we outline the theory for periodic solutions to the wave equation and compare these results to action potentials from the femoral nerve of the locust (locusta migratoria). In particular, we describe the frequently occurring minimum-distance doublet pulses seen in these neurons and compare them to the periodic pulse solutions.",Periodic solutions and refractory periods in the soliton theory for   nerves and the locust femoral nerve

Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators.

We access the many-body localized state using a standard fixed point Hamiltonian, and we show that operators exhibit slow logarithmic growth under time evolution. We compare the result with the expected growth of commutators in both localized and delocalized non-interacting disordered models.

The origin and nature of the splitting are elucidated with a simple physical argument based on the nature of the intermediate excited state in the sequential tunneling approach. We show that this splitting is sensitive to the number parity of electrons in the dot and the dot's ground-state spin. These effects are suppressed when cotunneling dominates the electrical and thermal conductances.

314,1,0603328v2,"Transient homogeneous nucleation is studied in the limit of large critical sizes. Starting from pure monomers, three eras of transient nucleation are characterized in the classic Becker-D\""oring kinetic equations with the Turnbull-Fisher discrete diffusivity. After an initial stage in which the number of monomers decreases, many clusters of small size are produced and a continuous size distribution is created. During the second era, nucleii are increasing steadily in size in such a way that their distribution appears as a wave front advancing towards the critical size for steady nucleation. The nucleation rate at critical size is negligible during this era. After the wave front reaches critical size, it ignites the creation of supercritical clusters at a rate that increases monotonically until its steady value is reached. Analytical formulas for the transient nucleation rate and the time lag are obtained that improve classical ones and compare very well with direct numerical solutions. In addition, we propose and solve numerically a modified Becker-D\""oring model having a discrete diffusivity proportional to the area of a spherical cluster with $k$ monomers for small $k$ (as in the Turnbull-Fisher case) and to the cluster radius for large $k$ (as in the case of diffusive growth of clusters).",Asymptotic and numerical studies of the Becker-Doering model for   transient homogeneous nucleation

314,3,0702158v1,"Understanding the mechanism of nucleation of the stable phase inside the metastable parent phase during a first order phase transition has been a subject of outstanding interest in natural science. The problem becomes even more challenging as the spinodal is approached. In this work, we have undertaken extensive computer simulation studies to probe the molecular mechanism for the onset of instability. We have constructed the free energy surfaces of nucleation as a function of multiple reaction coordinates, both for supercooled Lennard-Jones fluid and for 2- and 3-dimensional Ising models. While the classical Becker-Doring (BD) picture of homogenous nucleation, that assumes the growth of a single nucleus by single particle addition, holds good at low to moderate supersaturation, the formation of the new stable phase becomes more collective and spread over the whole system at large supersaturation. As the spinodal curve is approached from the coexistence line, the free energy, as a function of the size of the largest liquid-like cluster, develops a minimum at a sub-critical cluster size. This minimum at intermediate size is responsible for the barrier towards further growth of the nucleus at large supersaturation. As the spinodal is approached closely, this minimum gradually disappears and so does the free energy barrier for the cluster growth. We find the emergence of an alternative free energy pathway (with a barrier less than that in the BD picture) that involves participation of many sub-critical liquid-like clusters and the growth of the stable phase is promoted by a coalescence mechanism. Very close to the spinodal the free energy surface becomes quite flat, the significance of a critical nucleus is lost and the classical Becker-Doring picture of nucleation breaks down.",Mechanism of nucleation and growth near the gas-liquid spinodal

Second, the properties of the stationary concentration field in the fully controlled case are studied to derive the remaining nucleation probability and thus to characterize the loss of nucleation control.

316,1,0503220v2,"There have been many discussions of two-mode models for Bose condensates in a double well potential, but few cases in which parameters for these models have been calculated for realistic situations. Recent experiments lead us to use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to obtain optimum two-mode parameters. We find that by using the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions, it is possible to derive equations for a more exact two-mode model that provides for a variable tunneling rate depending on the instantaneous values of the number of atoms and phase differences. Especially for larger values of the nonlinear interaction term and larger barrier heights, results from this model produce better agreement with numerical solutions of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 1D and 3D, as compared with previous models with constant tunneling, and better agreement with experimental results for the tunneling oscillation frequency [Albiez et al., cond-mat/0411757].

There exists a critical strength of interactions beyond which quasiperiodic motion becomes chaotic, resulting in an instability of the condensate manifested by exponential growth in the number of noncondensed atoms. In the stable regime, the system remains predominantly in the two lowest energy states and may be mapped onto a spin model, from which we obtain an analytic expression for the beat frequency and discuss the route to instability. We numerically explore parameter regime for the occurrence of instability and reveal the characteristic density profile for both condensed and noncondensed atoms. The Arnold diffusion to higher energy levels is found to be responsible for the transition to instability.

Between $E^{(per)}$ and $E^{(inj)}$, the chain migration is dictated by the driven activation process. In particular, at $E>E^{(def)}$, the stuck chain at the slit entrance is strongly deformed, which enhances the rate of the permeation. From these observations, electrophoretic mobility at a given electric field is deduced, which shows non-monotonic dependence on $N$.

The concentration of salt and the size of tetravalent counterions are found playing a decisive role on chain properties. If the size of tetravalent counterions is compatible with the one of monomers, the chains show extended structures at low and at high salt concentrations, whereas at intermediate salt concentrations, they acquire compact and prolate structures. The swelling exponent of a chain against salt concentration behaves in an analogous way as the morphological quantities. Under certain condition, the electrostatics gives a negative contribution to the persistence length, in companion with a salt-induced mechanical instability of polyelectrolytes. Nearly at the same moment, it appears like-charge attraction between chains. The equal size of the tetravalent ions and the monomers is the optimal condition to attain the strongest attraction between chains and the most compact chain structure. Moreover, the ions form a multi-layer organization around a chain and, thus, the integrated charge distribution reveals an oscillatory behavior.

The capacity of erythrocytes to load and unload oxygen is thus a determinant factor in their efficacy. In this paper, we will focus on the pulmonary capillary where red blood cells capture oxygen. We propose a camera method in order to numerically study the behavior of the red blood cell along a whole capillary. Our goal is to understand how erythrocytes geometrical changes along the capillary can affect its capacity to capture oxygen.

The membrane of the red blood cell is complex and has been modelled by an hyper-elastic approach coming from Mills et al (2004). This camera method is then validated and confronted with a standard ALE method. Some geometrical properties of the red blood cells observed in our simulations are then studied and discussed.

In particular a magnetic field can induce an anomalous current via the chiral magnetic effect and a vortex in the relativistic fluid can also induce a current via the chiral vortical effect. The related transport coefficients can be calculated via Kubo formulas. We evaluate the Kubo formula for the anomalous vortical conductivity at weak coupling and show that it receives contributions proportional to the gravitational anomaly coefficient.

This allows to identify several approaches to reach the strong-coupling limit for the quantum gas polarons, whereas this limit was hitherto experimentally inaccessible in solids. We apply Feynman's path-integral method to calculate for all coupling strengths the polaronic shift in the free energy and the increase in the effective mass. The effect of temperature on these quantities is included in the description.

The spin polarization vectors of individual bands are determined by a two-step fitting routine. First, the measured intensities are fitted with an appropriate number of suitable peaks to quantify the contributions of the individual bands, then the measured spin polarization curves are fitted by varying for each band the polarization direction and its magnitude. We confirm that the surface states experience a large spin splitting. Moreover, we find that all surface state bands are 100 percent spin polarized, and that for some states spin polarization vectors rotate out of the surface plane.",Quantitative vectorial spin analysis in ARPES: Bi/Ag(111) and Pb/Ag(111)

When interacting with an electromagnetic field such states are expected to have resonances when the frequency of the field is near the energy of the spin-orbit splitting $\Delta$. These resonances originate in the intersubband transitions between spin-split subbands. Such resonances can be observed in the frequency dependence of the surface impedance. Plasmons in thin metal films are gapless and can be strongly affected by these spin resonances, acquiring significant modification of the spectrum when it intersects the $\omega=\Delta$ line. Finally, an interesting demonstration of the intersubband resonances can be obtained when metal films are coated with ionic dielectrics that have a frequency of longitudinal/transverse optical phonons above/below $\Delta$. The dielectric function between the two optical phonon frequencies is negative which forbids propagation of conventional plasmon-polaritons.

329,1,1205.6853v2,"Several previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown that a leading edge vortex (LEV) on an airfoil or wing can provide lift enhancement. In this paper, unsteady 2D potential flow theory is employed to model the flow field of a flapping flat plate wing. A multi-vortices model is developed to model both the leading edge and trailing edge vortices (TEVs), which offers improved accuracy compared with using only single vortex at each separation location. The lift is obtained by integrating the unsteady Blasius equation. It is found that the motion of vortices contributes significantly to the overall aerodynamic force on the flat plate. The shedding of TEVs and the stabilization of LEVs explicitly contributes to lift enhancement. A Kutta-like condition is used to determine the vortex intensity and location at the leading edge for large angle of attack cases; however, it is proposed to relax this condition for small angle of attack cases and apply a 2D shear layer model to calculate the circulation of the new added vortex. The results of the simulation are then compared with classical numerical, modeled and experimental data for canonical unsteady flat plat problems. Good agreement with these data is observed. Moreover, these results suggested that the leading edge vortex shedding for small angles of attack should be modeled differently than that for large angles of attack. Finally, the results of vortex motion vs. lift indicate that both a motion against the streamwise direction of the LEV and a streamwise motion of the TEV contributes positive lift. This also provides the insights for future active flow control of MAVs that the formation and shedding process of LEVs and TEVs can be manipulated to provide lift enhancement.",Lift Evaluation of a 2D Flapping Flat Plate

Temporal profiles of unsteady forces; lift and thrust, and their spectral analysis clearly indicate the solution to be a period-1 attractor for low Strouhal numbers. This study reveals that aerodynamic forces produced by plunging airfoil are independent of initial kinematic conditions of airfoil that proves the existence of limit cycle. Frequencies present in the oscillating lift force are composed of fundamental (fs), even and odd harmonics (3fs) at higher Strouhal numbers. Using numerical simulations, shedding frequencies (f_s) were observed to be nearly equal to the excitation frequencies in all the cases. Unsteady lift force generated due to the plunging airfoil is modeled by modified van der Pol oscillator. Using method of multiple scales and spectral analysis of steady-state CFD solutions, frequencies and damping terms in the van der Pol oscillator model are estimated.

The development of these vortices in the near wake, in combination with the large Reynolds numbers present in these cases, make these types of test cases particularly challenging to investigate numerically. We first give an overview of the Spectral Vanishing Viscosity--implicit LES (SVV-iLES) solver that is used to perform the simulations, and highlight techniques that have been adopted to solve various numerical issues that arise when studying such cases. To demonstrate the method's viability, we present results from numerical simulations of flow over a NACA 0012 profile wingtip at $Re_c = 1.2\cdot 10^6$ and compare them against experimental data, which is to date the highest Reynolds number achieved for a LES that has been correlated with experiments for this test case.

329,5,1611.05729v1,"Unsteady inviscid flow models of wings and airfoils have been developed to study the aerodynamics of natural and man-made flyers. Vortex methods have been extensively applied to reduce the dimensionality of these aerodynamic models, based on the proper estimation of the strength and distribution of the vortices in the wake. In such modeling approaches, one of the most fundamental questions is how the vortex sheets are generated and released from sharp edges. To determine the formation of the trailing-edge vortex sheet, the classical Kutta condition can be extended to unsteady situations by realizing that a flow cannot turn abruptly around a sharp edge. This condition can be readily applied to a flat plate or an airfoil with cusped trailing edge since the direction of the forming vortex sheet is known to be tangential to the trailing edge. However, for a finite-angle trailing edge, or in the case of flow separation away from a sharp corner, the direction of the forming vortex sheet is ambiguous. To remove any ad-hoc implementation, the unsteady Kutta condition, the conservation of circulation, as well as the conservation laws of mass and momentum are coupled to analytically solve for the angle, strength, and relative velocity of the trailing-edge vortex sheet. The two-dimensional aerodynamic model together with the proposed vortex-sheet formation condition is verified by comparing flow structures and force calculations with experimental results for airfoils in steady and unsteady background flows.",Unsteady Aerodynamics and Vortex-sheet Formation of A Two-dimensional   Airfoil

The method is based on performing a exact numerical integral over the zero-Matsubara-frequency component of the spin part of a continuous Hubbard-Stratonovich field, along with a spin-field-dependent steepest descents treatment of the charge part. We test this method by applying it to one or two site approximations to the single band Hubbard model with different band structures, and comparing the results to quantum Monte-Carlo and simplified exact diagonalization calculations. The resulting electron self-energies, densities of states and magnetic transition temperatures show reasonable agreement with the quantum Monte-Carlo simulation over wide parameter ranges, suggesting that the semiclassical method is useful for obtaining a reasonable picture of the physics in situations where other techniques are too expensive.",Benchmarking a semiclassical impurity solver for dynamical-mean-field   theory: self-energies and magnetic transitions of the single-orbital Hubbard   model

331,1,0501753v1,A ringing free bit addressing scheme for magnetic memories like MRAM (magnetic random access memory) is proposed. As in standard MRAM addressing schemes the switching of a selected cell is obtained by the combination of two half-select field pulses. Numerical solutions of a single spin model of an MRAM cell show that the pulse parameters can be chosen such that the application of the half select pulse induces a full precessional turn of the magnetization (no switch) whereas the superposition of two half select pulses induces a half precessional turn (switch). With well adapted pulse parameters both fullselect and half-select switching occurs on ballistic trajectories characterized by the absence of ringing after magnetic pulse decay. Such ballistic bit addressing allows ultra high MRAM clock rates. 1,Ballistic bit addressing in a magnetic memory cell array

331,4,0907.1600v1,"An annular magnetic memory that uses a spin-polarized current to switch the magnetization direction or helicity of a magnetic region is proposed. The device has magnetic materials in the shape of a ring (1 to 5 nm in thickness, 20 to 250 nm in mean radius and 8 to 100 nm in width), comprising a reference magnetic layer with a fixed magnetic helicity and a free magnetic layer with a changeable magnetic helicity. These are separated by a thin non-magnetic layer. Information is written using a current flowing perpendicular to the layers, inducing a spin-transfer torque that alters the magnetic state of the free layer. The resistance, which depends on the magnetic state of the device, is used to read out the stored information. This device offers several important advantages compared to conventional spin-transfer magnetic random access memory (MRAM) devices. First, the ring geometry offers stable magnetization states, which are, nonetheless, easily altered with short current pulses. Second, the ring geometry naturally solves a major challenge of spin-transfer devices: writing requires relatively high currents and a low impedance circuit, whereas readout demands a larger impedance and magnetoresistance. The annular device accommodates these conflicting requirements by performing reading and writing operations at separate read and write contacts placed at different locations on the ring.",Annular Spin-Transfer Memory Element
331,5,1105.5473v1,"A new class of spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is discussed, in which writing is achieved using thermally initiated magnonic current pulses as an alternative to conventional electric current pulses. The magnonic pulses are used to destabilize the magnetic free layer from its initial direction, and are followed immediately by a bipolar electric current exerting conventional spin-transfer torque on the free layer. The combination of thermal and electric currents greatly reduces switching errors, and simultaneously reduces the electric switching current density by more than an order of magnitude as compared to conventional STT-MRAM. The energy efficiency of several possible electro-thermal circuit designs have been analyzed numerically. As compared to STT-MRAM with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, magnonic STT-MRAM reduces the overall switching energy by almost 80%. Furthermore, the lower electric current density allows the use of thicker tunnel barriers, which should result in higher tunneling magneto-resistance and improved tunnel barrier reliability. The combination of lower power, improved reliability, higher integration density, and larger read margin make magnonic STT-MRAM a promising choice for future non-volatile storage.","Magnonic spin-transfer torque MRAM with low power, high speed, and   error-free switching"

In the presence of FA/HA, Eu(III) sorption was enhanced at pH < 4, decreased at pH range of 4 - 6, and then increased again at pH > 7.

We have performed theoretical calculations based on Density Functional Theory to calculate the ground state band structure of Ce-doped materials as well as the Ce3+ excited state. The excited state calculations used a constrained occupancy approach by setting the occupation of the Ce 4f states to zero and allowing the first excited state above them to be filled. These calculations were performed on a set of Ce doped materials that are known from experiment to be scintillators or non-scintillators to relate theoretically calculable parameters to measured scintillator performance.

The positions of the Ce 4f states relative to the valence band maximum and the position of the Ce 5d states relative to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the host material are determined. We find, unlike Ce activated La and Y compounds where the CBM is typically of La 5d or Y 4d character, that, in these systems the CBM is predominately of d character on the Ti, Zr, Hf atoms.

PNIPA is soluble in water, but has a lower critical solution temperature at 32 C (LCST). Below the LCST the PNIPA shell is swollen.

The incubation time of the polymer solution at such a high temperature is traditionally kept to a minimum to minimize its impact on the subsequent gelation. Here we study the effect of a prolonged heating of a 1.5\% w/w agar solution at $T=80^{\circ}$C, well above the gelling temperature. The incubation time $\mathcal{T}$ of the polysaccharide solution is varied from a few hours up to five days. We show that the agar solution ages as the result of both the hydrolysis and the intramolecular oxidation of the polysaccharides. As a consequence, both the viscosity and the pH of the solution decrease continuously during the incubation period. Furthermore, samples withdrew at different incubation times are cooled down to form gels which structure and mechanical properties are systematically determined. Cryo-microscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments reveal that agar gels formed from solutions of increasing incubation times, display a coarser microstructure composed of micron-sized foils which result from the condensation of the polysaccharides and contrast with the fibrous-like microstructure of gels prepared from a fresh agar solution. Along with structural changes, a prolonged incubation time of the polymer solution at $T=80^{\circ}$C leads to weaker agar gels of significantly lower shear elastic modulus. Moreover, extensive macro-indentation experiments coupled to direct visualization show that increasing the incubation time of the agar solution up to a few days decreases the yield strain of the gel, while the rupture scenario turns continuously from brittle to ductile-like.

PNIPAM hydrogel films with same cross-link density are synthesized on a wide range of thickness, from nanometers to micrometers. The swelling-collapse transition with temperature is studied by using ellipsometry, neutron reflectivity, and atomic force microscopy as complementary surface-probing techniques. Sharp and high amplitude temperature-induced phase transition is observed for all submicrometric PNIPAM hydrogel films. For temperature above LCST, surface-attached PNIPAM hydrogels collapse similarly but without complete expulsion of water. For temperature below LCST, the swelling of PNIPAM hydrogels depends on the film thickness. It is shown that the swelling is strongly affected by the surface attachment for ultrathin films below $\sim$150 nm. For thicker films above 150 nm (to micrometers), surface-attached polymer networks with the same cross-link density swell equally.

The approach generalizes to finite momentum transfer a method used extensively to model x-ray absorption spectra (XAS), and includes both near edge spectra and extended fine structure. The calculations can be used to analyze experimental results of inelastic scattering from core-electrons using either x-ray photons (NRIXS) or electrons (EELS). In the low momentum transfer region (the dipole limit), these inelastic loss spectra are proportional to those from XAS.

A number of the negatively charged clusters incorporating a point defect and one or more arsenic atoms are investigated. It is shown that for the doubly negatively charged clusters or for clusters incorporating more than one arsenic atom the electron density reaches a maximum value and then monotonically and slowly decreases as total arsenic concentration increases. In the case of doubly negatively charged cluster incorporating two arsenic atoms, the calculated electron density agrees well with the experimental data. Agreement with the experiment confirms the conclusion that two arsenic atoms participate in the cluster formation.

The details of such shear localization can vary depending on the system being studied. A number of the systems of interest are confined so as to be quasi-two dimensional, and an important issue in these systems is the role of the confining boundaries. For foams, three basic systems have been studied with very different boundary conditions: Hele-Shaw cells (bubbles confined between two solid plates); bubble rafts (a single layer of bubbles freely floating on a surface of water); and confined bubble rafts (bubbles confined between the surface of water below and a glass plate on top). Often, it is assumed that the impact of the boundaries is not significant in the ``quasi-static limit'', i.e. when externally imposed rates of strain are sufficiently smaller than internal kinematic relaxation times. In this paper, we directly test this assumption for rates of strain ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2} {\rm s^{-1}}$.

A scaling analysis using a flexible plate model for the wings points out that, for flapping flyers in air, the time-dependent shape of the elastic bending wing is governed by the wing inertia. Based on this prediction, we define the ratio of the inertial forces deforming the wing to the elastic restoring force that limits the deformation as the \emph{elasto-inertial number} $\mathcal{N}_{ei}$.

Here we use an experiment with a self-propelled simplified insect model allowing to show how wing compliance governs the performance of flapping flyers. Reducing the description of the flapping wing to a forced oscillator model, we pinpoint different nonlinear effects that can account for the observed behavior ---in particular a set of cubic nonlinearities coming from the clamped-free beam equation used to model the wing and a quadratic damping term representing the fluid drag associated to the fast flapping motion. In contrast to what has been repeatedly suggested in the literature, we show that flapping flyers optimize their performance not by especially looking for resonance to achieve larger flapping amplitudes with less effort, but by tuning the temporal evolution of the wing shape (i.e. the phase dynamics in the oscillator model) to optimize the aerodynamics.","Rather than resonance, flapping wing flyers may play on aerodynamics to   improve performance"

While the fruit fly flies at $Re \approx 120$, the jewel wasp flies at $Re \approx 60$, and thrips flies at $Re \approx 10$.

342,5,1110.3515v1,"Diversity and specialization of behavior in insects is unmatched. Insects hop, walk, run, jump, row, swim, glide and fly to propel themselves in a variety of environments. We have uncovered an unusual mode of propulsion of aerodynamic flight in two dimensions in Waterlilly Beetles \emph{(Galerucella)}. The adult beetles, often found in water lilly ponds, propel themselves strictly in a two-dimensional plane on the surface of water via flapping wing flight. Here we analyze the aerodynamics of this peculiar flight mode with respect to forces exerted on the organism during flight. The complexity of 2-D flight is captured by accounting for additional forces beyond gravitational, thrust, lift and drag, exerted on the insect body in 3D flight. Understanding this constrained propulsion mode requires accounting for viscous drag, surface tension, buoyancy force, and capillary-wave drag. Moreover, dramatic differences exist in the magnitude of the resultant forces in 2D vs. 3D flight. Here, in this fluid dynamics video, we discuss this unusual 2D flight mode via kinematic and non-dimensional analysis comparing it to 3D flight and draw generalized lessons towards understanding surface skimming based origin of flight in insects.",Flying in Two Dimensions
343,1,0510677v2,"We present results on a series of 2D atomistic computer simulations of amorphous systems subjected to simple shear in the athermal, quasistatic limit. The athermal quasistatic trajectories are shown to separate into smooth, reversible elastic branches which are intermittently broken by discrete catastrophic plastic events. The onset of a typical plastic event is studied with precision, and it is shown that the mode of the system which is responsible for the loss of stability has structure in real space which is consistent with a quadrupolar source acting on an elastic matrix. The plastic events themselves are shown to be composed of localized shear transformations which organize into lines of slip which span the length of the simulation cell, and a mechanism for the organization is discussed. Although within a single event there are strong spatial correlations in the deformation, we find little correlation from one event to the next, and these transient lines of slip are not to be confounded with the persistent regions of localized shear -- so-called ""shear bands"" -- found in related studies. The slip lines gives rise to particular scalings with system length of various measures of event size. Strikingly, data obtained using three differing interaction potentials can be brought into quantitative agreement after a simple rescaling, emphasizing the insensitivity of the emergent plastic behavior in these disordered systems to the precise details of the underlying interactions. The results should be relevant to understanding plastic deformation in systems such as metallic glasses well below their glass temperature, soft glassy systems (such as dense emulsions), or compressed granular materials.","Amorphous Systems in Athermal, Quasistatic Shear"
343,2,0612620v1,"We develop an athermal shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of plastic deformation in spatially inhomogeneous, amorphous solids. Our ultimate goal is to describe the dynamics of the boundaries of voids or cracks in such systems when they are subjected to remote, time-dependent tractions. The theory is illustrated here for the case of a circular hole in an infinite two-dimensional plate, a highly symmetric situation that allows us to solve much of the problem analytically. In spite of its special symmetry, this example contains many general features of systems in which stress is concentrated near free boundaries and deforms them irreversibly. We depart from conventional treatments of such problems in two ways. First, the STZ analysis allows us to keep track of spatially heterogeneous, internal state variables such as the effective disorder temperature, which determines plastic response to subsequent loading. Second, we subject the system to stress pulses of finite duration, and therefore are able to observe elasto-plastic response during both loading and unloading. We compute the final deformations and residual stresses produced by these stress pulses. Looking toward more general applications of these results, we examine the possibility of constructing a boundary-layer theory that might be useful in less symmetric situations.",Free-Boundary Dynamics in Elasto-plastic Amorphous Solids: The Circular   Hole Problem

This jamming-unjamming transition is naturally accounted for by the dynamics of a bistable internal state field. We show, within the athermal Shear Transformation Zones (STZ) theory of amorphous plasticity, that the transition is accompanied by the propagation of plastic fronts. We further show that the mean-field theory cannot select the velocity of these fronts and go beyond the mean-field description to include fluctuations and correlations effects, resulting in new nonlocal terms in the equations.

These modes pertain to perfect circular symmetry of the cavity and the stress conditions. In this paper we study the shape stability of the expanding circular cavity against perturbations, in both the unbounded and the bounded growth regimes (for the latter the unperturbed theory predicts no catastrophic failure). Since the unperturbed reference state is time dependent, the linear stability theory cannot be cast into standard time-independent eigenvalue analysis. The main results of our study are: (i) sufficiently small perturbations are stable, (ii) larger perturbations within the formal linear decomposition may lead to an instability; this dependence on the magnitude of the perturbations in the linear analysis is a result of the non-stationarity of the growth, (iii) the stability of the circular cavity is particularly sensitive to perturbations in the effective disorder temperature; in this context we highlight the role of the rate sensitivity of the limiting value of this effective temperature. Finally we point to the importance of the form of the stress-dependence of the rate of STZ transitions. The present analysis indicates the importance of nonlinear effects that were not taken into account yet. Even more importantly, the analysis suggests that details of the constitutive relations appearing in the theory can be constrained by the modes of macroscopic failure in these amorphous systems.",The Stability of an Expanding Circular Cavity and the Failure of   Amorphous Solids

345,2,0505110v1,"Using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we have explored the phenomenon of capillary condensation (CC) of Ar at the triple temperature inside infinitely long, cylindrical pores. Pores of radius R= 1 nm, 1.7 nm and 2.5 nm have been investigated, using a gas-surface interaction potential parameterized by the well-depth D of the gas on a planar surface made of the same material as that comprising the porous host. For strongly attractive situations, i.e., large D, one or more (depending on R) Ar layers adsorb successively before liquid fills the pore. For very small values of D, in contrast, negligible adsorption occurs at any pressure P below saturated vapor pressure P0; above saturation, there eventually occurs a threshold value of P at which the coverage jumps from empty to full, nearly discontinuously. Hysteresis is found to occur in the simulation data whenever abrupt CC occurs, i.e. for R>= 1.7 nm, and for small D when R=1nm. Then, the pore-emptying branch of the adsorption isotherm exhibits larger N than the pore-filling branch, as is known from many experiments and simulation studies. The relation between CC and wetting on planar surfaces is discussed in terms of a threshold value of D, which is about one-half of the value found for the wetting threshold on a planar surface. This finding is consistent with a simple thermodynamic model of the wetting transition developed previously.",Capillary condensation in cylindrical nanopores

We investigate the behavior of the model analytically in one dimension and numerically in two and three dimensions. These investigations allow us conclude that the model possesses the physically relevant directional properties, in particular, strains in different directions are different and the lack of any loading symmetries leads to development of ``shear'' stresses and displacements.",Polyconvex Model for Materials with Cubic Anisotropy

For a uniaxial stress in the 1-direction and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ defined by the contraction in the 2-direction, the following three quantities vanish at a stationary value: $s_{14}$, $[2\nu s_{15} + s_{25}]$ and $[(2 \nu -1)s_{16} + s_{26}]$, where $s_{IJ}$ are the components of the compliance tensor. Analogous conditions for stationary values of Young's modulus and the shear modulus are obtained, along with second derivatives of the three engineering moduli at the stationary values. The stationary conditions and the hessian matrices are presented in forms that are independent of the coordinates, which lead to simple search algorithms for extreme values. In each case the global extremes can be found by a simple search over the stretch direction $\bf n$ only.

The latter is commonly taken as the definition of pure shear, although a state of pure shear is more generally defined by tr(stress)=0. New results are presented that characterize all possible pure shear bases. A pair of vector functions are derived which generate a set of pure shear basis vectors from any one member of the triad. The vector functions follow from compatibility condition for the pure shear basis vectors, and are independent of the principal stress values. The complementary types of vector basis have implications for the strain energy of linearly elastic solids with cubic material symmetry: for a given state of stress or strain, the strain energy achieves its extreme values when the material cube axes are aligned with principal axes of stress or with a pure shear basis. This implies that the optimal orientation for a given state of stress is with one or the other vector basis, depending as the stress is to be minimized or maximized, which involves the sign of one material parameter.",Pure shear axes and elastic strain energy

Recent observations of optical phenomena above an active lightning discharge along with the availability of modern technology both for data collection and data analysis have renewed interest in the field of thunderstorms and their consequences in the biosphere. In this paper, we review the electrification processes of a thunderstorm, lightning processes and their association with global electric circuit and climate. The upward lightning discharge can cause sprites, elves, jets, etc. which are together called transient luminous events. Their morphological features and effects in the mesosphere are reviewed. The wide spectrum of electromagnetic waves generated during lightning discharges couple the lower atmosphere with the ionosphere/magnetosphere.

By 2010 February, GROWTH detected 7 long-duration $\gamma$-rays emissions associated with winter thunderstorms. Of them, two events, obtained on 2007 December 13 and 2008 December 25, are reported.On both occasions, all inorganic scintillators (NaI, CsI, and BGO) of the two subsystems detected significant gamma-ray signals lasting for >1 minute. Neither of these two events were associated with any lightning. In both cases, the gamma-ray energy spectra extend to 10 MeV, suggesting that the detected gamma-rays are produced by relativistic electrons via bremsstrahlung. Assuming that the initial photon spectrum at the source is expressed by a power-law function,the observed photons can be interpreted as being radiated from a source located at a distance of 290-560 m for the 2007 event and 110-690 m for the 2008 one, both at 90% confidence level.Employing these photon spectra, the number of relativistic electrons is estimated as 10^9 - 10^{11}. The estimation generally agrees with those calculated based on the relativistic runaway electron avalanche model.

Our aim is to characterize the flow-rate and the pressure in the contiguous zone to the main artery: using boundary layer theory we construct a homogenized first order approximation with respect to epsilon, the size of the stent's wires. This provides an explicit expression of the velocity profile through and along the stent. The profile depends only on the input/output pressure data of the problem and some homogenized constant quantities: it is explicit. In the collateral artery this gives the flow-rate. In the case of the aneurysm, it shows that : (i) the zeroth order term of the pressure in the sac equals the averaged pressure along the stent in the main artery, (ii) the presence of the stent inverses the rotation of the vortex.

This allows investigation of the effects of buoyancy, solubility, and blood pressure on embolus clearance.   Our results illustrate that blockages depend on several factors, including the number and size distribution of incident emboli, dissolution time and blood pressure. We found it essential to model the deformation of bubbles to avoid overestimation of arterial obstruction. Incorporation of buoyancy effects within our model slightly reduced the overall level of obstruction but did not decrease embolus clearance times.

The lattice Boltzmann is an easily parallelizable numerical method of solving the flow problems, but it suffers from errors of the velocity field near the boundaries which leads to errors in the wall shear stress and normal vectors computed from the velocity. In this work we present a simple formula to calculate the wall shear stress in the lattice Boltzmann model and propose to compute wall normals, which are necessary to compute the wall shear stress, by taking the weighted mean over boundary facets lying in a vicinity of a wall element. We carry out several tests and observe an increase of accuracy of computed normal vectors over other methods in two and three dimensions. Using the scheme we compute the wall shear stress in an inclined and bent channel fluid flow and show a minor influence of the normal on the numerical error, implying that that the main error arises due to a corrupted velocity field near the staircase boundary. Finally, we calculate the wall shear stress in the human abdominal aorta in steady conditions using our method and compare the results with a standard finite volume solver and experimental data available in the literature.

354,2,0906.2530v1,"We review connections between phase transitions in high-dimensional combinatorial geometry and phase transitions occurring in modern high-dimensional data analysis and signal processing. In data analysis, such transitions arise as abrupt breakdown of linear model selection, robust data fitting or compressed sensing reconstructions, when the complexity of the model or the number of outliers increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial geometry these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face counts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in these very different problems appear in the same critical locations after appropriate calibration of variables.   These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling, they place hard limits on the degree to which the now-ubiquitous high-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place hard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate outliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp boundary of the undersampling/sparsity tradeoff in undersampling theorems.   Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume the underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed (iid) Gaussian elements. In applications, however, it often seems that Gaussianity is not required. We conducted an extensive computational experiment and formal inferential analysis to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are {\it universal} across a range of underlying matrix ensembles. The experimental results are consistent with an asymptotic large-$n$ universality across matrix ensembles; finite-sample universality can be rejected.","Observed Universality of Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Geometry,   with Implications for Modern Data Analysis and Signal Processing"

Problems of this type can be solved by minimizing a cost function with respect to the $L_p$-norm $||\bx||_p=\lim_{\epsilon \to +0}\sum_{i=1}^N |x_i|^{p+\epsilon}$, subject to the constraints under an appropriate condition. For several $p$, we assess a typical case limit $\alpha_c(\rho)$, which represents a critical relation between $\alpha=P/N$ and $\rho$ for successfully reconstructing the original vector by minimization for typical situations in the limit $N,P \to \infty$ with keeping $\alpha$ finite, utilizing the replica method.

Accurate reconstruction is possible when the object to be recovered is sufficiently sparse in a known basis. Currently, the best known sparsity-undersampling tradeoff is achieved when reconstructing by convex optimization -- which is expensive in important large-scale applications. Fast iterative thresholding algorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization for large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer substantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization.   We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of the corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new iterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in graphical models. Our empirical measurements of the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff for the new algorithms agree with theoretical calculations.

The narrow Drude component locates at so low frequencies that no such behavior was observed in iron pnictides. The overall plasma frequency is found to be smaller than the FeAs based compounds, suggesting a stronger correlation effect. Similar to iron pnictides, a temperature-induced spectral weight transfer is observed for FeSe. However, the relevant energy scale is lower. Additionally, different from a recent ARPES measurement which revealed a spin density wave (SDW) order at low temperature for FeSe thin films grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrate, no signature of the band structure reconstruction arising from the formation of the SDW order is seen by optical measurement in the thick FeSe films.",In-plane optical spectroscopy study on FeSe epitaxial thin film grown on   SrTiO$_3$ substrate

With the first-principles calculations, we find that the substrate-induced tensile strain tends to stabilize the SDW state in FeSe thin film by enhancing of the next-nearest-neighbor superexchange antiferromagnetic interaction bridged through Se atoms. On the other hand, we find that when there are oxygen vacancies in the substrate, the significant charge transfer from the substrate to the first FeSe layer would suppress the magnetic order there, and thus the high-temperature superconductivity could occur. In addition, the stability of the SDW is lowered when FeSe is on a defect-free STO substrate due to the redistribution of charges among the Fe 3d-orbitals.

Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) further revealed a nearly isotropic gap of above 15 meV, which closes at a temperature of ~ 65 K. If this transition is indeed the superconducting transition, then the 1-UC FeSe represents the thinnest high TC superconductor discovered so far. However, up to date direct transport measurement of the 1-UC FeSe films has not been reported, mainly because growth of large scale 1-UC FeSe films is challenging and the 1-UC FeSe films are too thin to survive in atmosphere. In this work, we successfully prepared 1-UC FeSe films on insulating STO substrates with non-superconducting FeTe protection layers. By direct transport and magnetic measurements, we provide definitive evidence for high temperature superconductivity in the 1-UC FeSe films with an onset TC above 40 K and a extremely large critical current density JC ~ 1.7*106 A/cm2 at 2 K.

For the case of two impurities oscillating with the same frequency, we find a novel effect, namely, that the dc-component of the backscattering current is positive {\it even for weak repulsive interactions}, due to the presence of the interference term induced by spatial correlations in the Luttinger liquid.

359,3,0603090v2,"With understood exceptions, conventional superconductivity does not coexist with long-range magnetic order[1]. In contrast, unconventional superconductivity develops near a boundary separating magnetically ordered and magnetically disordered phases[2,3]. A maximum in the superconducting transition temperature Tc develops where this boundary extrapolates to T=0 K, suggesting that fluctuations associated with this magnetic quantum-critical point are essential for unconventional superconductivity[4,5]. Invariably though, unconventional superconductivity hides the magnetic boundary when T < Tc, preventing proof of a magnetic quantum-critical point[5]. Here we report specific heat measurements of the pressure-tuned unconventional superconductor CeRhIn5 in which we find a line of quantum-phase transitions induced inside the superconducting state by an applied magnetic field. This quantum-critical line separates a phase of coexisting antiferromagnetism and superconductivity from a purely unconventional superconducting phase and terminates at a quantum tetracritical point where the magnetic field completely suppresses superconductivity.

Side loads arise during low altitude flight due to random, asymmetric, shock-induced separation of in-nozzle boundary layers. In this paper, stochastic evolution of the in-nozzle boundary layer separation line, an essential feature underlying side load generation, is connected to random, altitude-dependent rotational and translational rocket response via a set of simple analytical models. Separation line motion, extant on a fast boundary layer time scale, is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Pitch and yaw responses, taking place on a long, rocket dynamics time scale, are shown to likewise evolve as OU processes. Stochastic, altitude-dependent rocket translational motion follows from linear, asymptotic versions of the full nonlinear equations of motion; the model is valid in the practical limit where random pitch, yaw, and roll rates all remain small. Computed altitudedependent rotational and translational velocity and displacement statistics are compared against those obtained using recently reported high fidelity simulations [Srivastava, Tkacik, and Keanini, J. Applied Phys., 108, 044911 (2010)]; in every case, reasonable agreement is observed. As an important prelude, evidence indicating the physical consistency of the model introduced in the above article is first presented: it is shown that the study's separation line model allows direct derivation of experimentally observed side load amplitude and direction densities.

Furthermore, we examined the influence of H1 defects on the properties of the chromatin fiber.

This fact poses the more general question of whether it is at all feasible that the numerous genes that are coregulated on a given chromosome, especially those at large genomic distances, might become proximate inside the nucleus. This problem is studied here using steered molecular dynamics simulations in order to enforce the colocalization of thousands of knowledge-based gene sequences on a model for the gene-rich human chromosome 19. Remarkably, it is found that most (~80%) gene pairs can be brought simultaneously into contact. This is made possible by the low degree of intra-chromosome entanglement and the large number of cliques in the gene coregulatory network, that is the many groups of genes that are all mutually coregulated. The constrained conformations for the model chromosome 19 are further shown to be organised in spatial macrodomains that are similar to those inferred from recent HiC measurements. The findings indicate that gene coregulation and colocalization are largely compatible and that this relationship can be exploited to draft the overall spatial organization of the chromosome in vivo. The more general validity and implications of these findings could be investigated by applying to other eukaryotic chromosomes the general and transferable computational strategy introduced here.",Colocalization of coregulated genes: a steered molecular dynamics study   of human chromosome 19

363,2,0701021v1,"A longstanding goal of research in semiconductor spintronics is the ability to inject, modulate, and detect electron spin in a single device. A simple prototype consists of a lateral semiconductor channel with two ferromagnetic contacts, one of which serves as a source of spin-polarized electrons and the other as a detector. Based on work in analogous metallic systems, two important criteria have emerged for demonstrating electrical detection of spin transport. The first is the measurement of a non-equilibrium spin population using a non-local ferromagnetic detector through which no charge current flows. The potential at the detection electrode should be sensitive to the relative magnetizations of the detector and the source electrodes, a property referred to as the spin-valve effect. A second and more rigorous test is the existence of a Hanle effect, which is the modulation and suppression of the spin valve signal due to precession and dephasing in a transverse magnetic field. Here we report on the observation of both the spin valve and Hanle effects in lateral devices consisting of epitaxial Fe Schottky tunnel barrier contacts on an n-doped GaAs channel. The dependence on transverse magnetic field, temperature, and contact separation are in good agreement with a model incorporating spin drift and diffusion. Spin transport is detected for both directions of current flow through the source electrode. The sign of the electrical detection signal is found to vary with the injection current and is correlated with the spin polarization in the GaAs channel determined by optical measurements.

But starting with Z > 5 the PMFEX model is substantially improved and the agreement with numerical simulations is excellent. We have also found that with increasing coupling the PMFEX approximation becomes invalid to predict the MFD at a neutral point while its corrected version agrees satisfactory with the simulations.",Renormalized cluster expansion of the microfield distribution in a   strongly coupled two-component plasmas
365,1,0509604v1,"A theory is presented for the effective charge of colloidal particles in suspensions containing multivalent counterions. It is shown that if colloids are sufficiently strongly charged, the number of condensed multivalent counterion can exceed the bare colloidal charge leading to charge reversal. Charge renormalization in suspensions with multivalent counterions depends on a subtle interplay between the solvation energies of the multivalent counterions in the bulk and near the colloidal surface. We find that the effective charge is {\it not} a monotonically decreasing function of the multivalent salt concentration. Furthermore, contrary to the previous theories, it is found that except at very low concentrations, monovalent salt hinders the charge reversal. This conclusion is in agreement with the recent experiments and simulations.",Charge reversal of colloidal particles
365,2,0602250v1,"Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to study the effective interactions in charged stabilized colloidal suspensions. For not too high macroion charges and sufficiently large screening, the concept of the potential of mean force is known to work well. In the present work, we focus on highly charged macroions in the limit of low salt concentrations. Within this regime, nonlinear corrections to the celebrated DLVO theory [B. Derjaguin and L. Landau, Acta Physicochem. USSR {\bf 14}, 633 (1941); E.J.W. Verwey and J.T.G. Overbeck, {\em Theory of the Stability of Lyotropic Colloids} (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1948)] have to be considered. For non--bulklike systems, such as isolated pairs or triples of macroions, we show, that nonlinear effects can become relevant, which cannot be described by the charge renormalization concept [S. Alexander et al., J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 80}, 5776 (1984)]. For an isolated pair of macroions, we find an almost perfect qualitative agreement between our simulation data and the primitive model. However, on a quantitative level, neither Debye-H\""uckel theory nor the charge renormalization concept can be confirmed in detail. This seems mainly to be related to the fact, that for small ion concentrations, microionic layers can strongly overlap, whereas, simultaneously, excluded volume effects are less important. In the case of isolated triples, where we compare between coaxial and triangular geometries, we find attractive corrections to pairwise additivity in the limit of small macroion separations and salt concentrations. These triplet interactions arise if all three microionic layers around the macroions exhibit a significant overlap. In contrast to the case of two isolated colloids, the charge distribution around a macroion in a triple is found to be anisotropic.",Nonlinear effects in charge stabilized colloidal suspensions
365,3,0603186v1,"We extend the classical Gouy-Chapman model of two planar parallel interacting double-layers, which is used as a first approximation to describe the force between colloidal particles, by considering the finite-thickness of the colloids. The formation of two additional double layers due to this finite thickness, modifies the interaction force compared to the Gouy-Chapman case, in which the colloids are semi-infinite objects. In this paper we calculate this interaction force and some other size-dependent properties using a mean field level of description, based on the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. We show that in the case of finite-size colloids, this equation can be set in a closed form depending on the geometrical parameters and on their surface charge. The corresponding linear (Debye-Huckel) theory and the well-known results for semi-infinite colloids are recovered from this formal solution after taking appropriate limits. We use a density functional corresponding to the PB level of description to show how in the case when the total colloidal charge is fixed, it redistribute itself on their surfaces to minimize the energy of the system depending on the afore mentioned parameters. We study how this charge relaxation affects the colloidal interactions.",Finite-Thickness and Charge Relaxation in Double-Layer Interactions
365,4,0605088v1,"The phase behavior of charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions is modeled by a combination of response theory for electrostatic interparticle interactions and variational theory for free energies. Integrating out degrees of freedom of the microions (counterions, salt ions), the macroion-microion mixture is mapped onto a one-component system governed by effective macroion interactions. Linear response of microions to the electrostatic potential of the macroions results in a screened-Coulomb (Yukawa) effective pair potential and a one-body volume energy, while nonlinear response modifies the effective interactions [A. R. Denton, \PR E {\bf 70}, 031404 (2004)]. The volume energy and effective pair potential are taken as input to a variational free energy, based on thermodynamic perturbation theory. For both linear and first-order nonlinear effective interactions, a coexistence analysis applied to aqueous suspensions of highly charged macroions and monovalent microions yields bulk separation of macroion-rich and macroion-poor phases below a critical salt concentration, in qualitative agreement with predictions of related linearized theories [R. van Roij, M. Dijkstra, and J.-P. Hansen, \PR E {\bf 59}, 2010 (1999); P. B. Warren, \JCP {\bf 112}, 4683 (2000)].

365,5,0608163v1,"We study macroion correlation effects on the thermodynamics of highly charged colloidal suspensions using a mean-field theory and primitive model computer simulations. We suggest a simple way to include the macroion correlations into the mean-field theory as an extension of the renormalized jellium model of Trizac and Levin [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 69}, 031403 (2004)]. The effective screening parameters extracted from our mean-field approach are then used in a one-component model with macroions interacting via Yukawa-like potential to predict macroion distributions. We find that inclusion of macroion correlations leads to a weaker screening and hence smaller effective macroion charge and lower osmotic pressure of the colloidal dispersion as compared to other mean-field models. This result is supported by a comparison to primitive model simulations and experiments for charged macroions in the low-salt regime, where the macroion correlations are expected to be significant.",Macroion correlation effects in electrostatic screening and   thermodynamics of highly charged colloids

Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), materials with interesting catalytic properties and with very large surface areas have been developed and have become commercially available. Unit cells of MOFs typically include hundreds of atoms, which make the application of standard Density-Functional methods computationally very expensive, sometimes even unfeasible. The aim of this paper is to prepare and to validate the Self-Consistent Charge Density-Functional based Tight Binding (SCC-DFTB) method for MOFs containing Cu, Zn and Al metal centers. The method has been validated against full hybrid density-functional calculations for model clusters, against gradient corrected density-functional calculations for supercells, and against experiment. Moreover, the modular concept of MOF chemistry has been discussed on the basis of their electronic properties.

Short pulses enable direct observation of fast molecular dynamics, whereas broad spectral bandwidth offers ways of controlling nonlinear optical processes by means of quantum interferences. Special care is usually taken to preserve the coherence of laser pulses as it determines the accuracy of a spectroscopic measurement. Here we present a new approach to coherent Raman spectroscopy based on deliberately introduced noise, which increases the spectral resolution, robustness and efficiency. We probe laser induced molecular vibrations using a broadband laser pulse with intentionally randomized amplitude and phase. The vibrational resonances result in and are identified through the appearance of intensity correlations in the noisy spectrum of coherently scattered photons. Spectral resolution is neither limited by the pulse bandwidth, nor sensitive to the quality of the temporal and spectral profile of the pulses. This is particularly attractive for the applications in microscopy, biological imaging and remote sensing, where dispersion and scattering properties of the medium often undermine the applicability of ultrafast lasers.

Focusing on ""phase only"" description of the high-temperature superconducting system in terms of collective variables we utilize a three-dimensional semi microscopic XY model with two-component vectors that involve phase variables and adjustable parameters representing microscopic phase stiffnesses. The model captures characteristic energy scales present in YBCO and allows for strong anisotropy within basal planes to simulate oxygen ordering. Applying spherical closure relation we have solved the phase XY model with the help of transfer matrix method and calculated Tc for chosen system parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of oxygen ordering and doping imbalance on the shape of YBCO phase diagram. We find it unlikely that oxygen ordering alone can be responsible for the existence of 60-K plateau. Relying on experimental data unveiling that oxygen doping of YBCO may introduce significant charge imbalance between CuO2 planes and other sites, we show that simultaneously the former are underdoped, while the latter -- strongly overdoped almost in the whole region of oxygen doping in which YBCO is superconducting. As a result, while oxygen content is increased, this provides two counter acting factors, which possibly lead to rise of 60K plateau. Additionally, our result can provide an important contribution to understanding of experimental data supporting existence of multicomponent superconductivity in YBCO.",Possible origin of 60-K plateau in the YBa2Cu3O(6+y) phase diagram

When annealed at a given temperature and oxygen partial pressure, a small but systematic variation in S[290K] was observed with Zn, for all the samples. From the analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity, drho/dT, at 300K, which varies almost linearly with p, irrespective of the composition of the sample, and the thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), we have found that annealing under identical conditions makes the Zn-substituted compounds somewhat more oxygen deficient compared to the Zn-free ones.",The effect of Zn substitution on the state of oxygen deficiency and hole   concentration in Y1-xCaxBa2(Cu1-yZny)3O7-d

We consider this a revelation of retarded oxygen diffusion into the O(1) sites during the post-deposition annealing in the presence of interface mismatch strain. Near the free surface, the oxygen-deficiency was much alleviated because of the partial strain relaxation and the crystal symmetry becomes orthorhombic.

Likelihood of the Bayesian model constructed with the Maxwell's equations, specifically Gauss's law of magnetism and Amp\`ere's law, results in infinite number of solutions if two or more magnetic signals are missing. This undesirable characteristic of the Bayesian model is remediated by coupling the model with the Gaussian process. Our proposed numerical method infers the missing magnetic signals correctly in less than $1$\:msec suitable for real-time reconstruction of magnetic equilibria during tokamak operations.

However, reproducing sustainable nuclear fusion reactions here on Earth is a tremendous scientific and technical challenge. Special devices -- called tokamaks -- have been built around the world, with JET (Joint European Torus, in the UK) being the largest tokamak currently in operation. Such devices confine matter and heat it up to extremely high temperatures, creating a plasma where fusion reactions begin to occur. JET has over one hundred diagnostic systems to monitor what happens inside the plasma, and each 30-second experiment (or pulse) generates about 50 GB of data. In this work, we show how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to reconstruct the 2D plasma profile inside the device based on data coming from those diagnostics.

However, before this can be done, disruptions must first be predicted with sufficient warning time to actuate a response. The established field of survival analysis provides a convenient statistical framework for time-to-event (i.e. time-to-disruption) studies. This paper demonstrates the integration of an existing disruption prediction machine learning algorithm with the Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival probability. Specifically discussed are the implied warning times from binary classification of disruption databases and the interpretation of output signals from Random Forest algorithms trained and tested on these databases. This survival analysis approach is applied to both smooth and noisy test data to highlight important features of the survival and hazard functions. In addition, this method is applied to three Alcator C-Mod plasma discharges and compared to a threshold-based scheme for triggering alarms. In one case, both techniques successfully predict the disruption; although, in another, neither warns of the impending disruption with enough time to mitigate. For the final discharge, the survival analysis approach could avoid the false alarm triggered by the threshold method.

However, its elastic constants seem just as strange as its volume because NTE makes temperature acts as positive pressure, decreasing volume on warming and, unlike most materials, the thermally-compressed solid softens. Does ZrW2O8 also soften when pressure alone is applied? Using pulse-echo ultrasound in a hydrostatic SiC anvil cell, we determine the elastic tensor of monocrystalline ZrW2O8 near 300 K as a function of pressure. We indeed find an unusual decrease in bulk modulus with pressure. Our results are inconsistent with conventional lattice dynamics, but do show that the thermodynamically-complete constrained-lattice model can relate NTE to elastic softening as increases in either temperature or pressure reduce volume, establishing the predictive power of the model, and making it an important concept in condensed-matter physics.",Unusual compressibility in the negative-thermal-expansion material   ZrW2O8

It is considered that the particle diameter is much smaller than the incident wavelength, i.e. the so-called Rayleigh scattering limit. Moreover, the particle absorption assumed here is due to the attenuation of compressional waves only. Shear waves inside and outside the particle are neglected, since the inner and outer viscous boundary layer of the particle are supposed to be much smaller than the particle radius. The obtained radiation force formulas are used to establish the trapping conditions of a particle by a single-beam acoustical tweezer based on a spherically focused ultrasound beam. In this case, it is shown that the particle absorption has a pivotal role in single-beam trapping at the transducer focal region.

In the present study, we considered extended acoustic manipulation whereby millimetre-sized particles were levitated and moved three-dimensionally by localised ultrasonic standing waves, which were generated by ultrasonic phased arrays. Our manipulation system has two original features. One is the direction of the ultrasound beam, which is arbitrary because the force acting toward its centre is also utilised. The other is the manipulation principle by which a localised standing wave is generated at an arbitrary position and moved three-dimensionally by opposed and ultrasonic phased arrays.

Bulk Zn1-xCoxO with a low defect density and x in the range used in experimental thin film studies exhibits ferromagnetism only at very low temperatures. Therefore defects in thin film samples or nanocrystals may play an important role in promoting magnetic interactions between Co ions in Zn1-xCoxO. The electronic structures of Co substituted for Zn in ZnO, Zn and O vacancies, substituted N and interstitial Zn in ZnO were calculated using the B3LYP hybrid density functional in a supercell. The B3LYP functional predicts a band gap of 3.34 eV for bulk ZnO, close to the experimental value of 3.47 eV. Occupied minority spin Co 3d levels are at the top of the valence band and unoccupied levels lie above the conduction band minimum. Majority spin Co 3d levels hybridize strongly with bulk ZnO states. The neutral O vacancy and interstitial Zn are deep and shallow donors, respectively. The Zn vacancy is a deep acceptor and the acceptor level for substituted N is at mid gap.

We show that when the motility parameters depend on density $\rho$ but not on ${\bf u}$, the coarse-grained fluctuating hydrodynamics of interacting ABPs and RTPs can be mapped onto each other and are thus strictly equivalent. In both cases, a steeply enough decreasing $v(\rho)$ causes phase separation in dimensions $d=2,3$, even when no attractive forces act between the particles. This points to a generic role for motility-induced phase separation in active matter.

For densities larger than a characteristic value clusters grow in time and form a stationary well-ordered state of coherent macroscopic motion. In this work we address two questions: (i) What is the role of the particles' aspect ratio in the context of cluster formation, and does the particle shape affect the system's behavior on hydrodynamic scales? (ii) To what extent does particle conservation influence pattern formation? To answer these questions we suggest a simple kinetic model permitting to depict some of the interaction properties between freely moving particles and particles integrated in clusters. To this end, we introduce two particle species: single and cluster particles. Specifically, we account for coalescence of clusters from single particles, assembly of single particles on existing clusters, collisions between clusters, and cluster disassembly. Coarse-graining our kinetic model, (i) we demonstrate that particle shape (i.e. aspect ratio) shifts the scale of the transition density, but does not impact the instabilities at the ordering threshold. (ii) We show that the validity of particle conservation determines the existence of a longitudinal instability, which tends to amplify density heterogeneities locally, and in turn triggers a wave pattern with wave vectors parallel to the axis of macroscopic order. If the system is in contact with a particle reservoir this instability vanishes due to a compensation of density heterogeneities.",Role of particle conservation in self-propelled particle systems

To date, almost all these studies have been restricted to 2 dimensions. In this work we study activity-induced phase separation in 3D and compare the results with previous and new 2D simulations. To this end, we performed state-of-the-art Brownian dynamics simulations of up to 40 million ABPs -- such very large system sizes are unavoidable to evade finite size effects in 3D. Our results confirm the picture established for 2D systems in which an activity-induced phase separation occurs, with strong analogies to equilibrium gas-liquid spinodal decomposition, in spite of the purely non-equilibrium nature of the driving force behind the phase separation. However, we also find important differences between the 2D and 3D cases. Firstly, the shape and position of the phase boundaries is markedly different for the two cases. Secondly, for the 3D coarsening kinetics we find that the domain size grows in time according to the classical diffusive $t^{1/3}$ law, in contrast to the nonstandard subdiffusive exponent observed in 2D.",Phase behaviour of active Brownian particles: The role of dimensionality

A MMF is in the strong-coupling regime when the total length of the MMF is much greater than the correlation length over which local principal modes can be considered constant. In this regime, the GDs can be described as the eigenvalues of zero-trace Gaussian unitary ensemble, and the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the GDs is the eigenvalue distribution of the ensemble. For fibers with two to seven modes, the marginal p.d.f. of the GDs is derived analytically. For fibers with a large number of modes, this p.d.f. is shown to approach a semicircle distribution. In the strong-coupling regime, the delay spread is proportional to the square root of the number of independent sections, or the square root of the overall fiber length.

Global mean surface temperature in the later period has been about 0.3C higher than in the earlier period.

Minkowski's tensor predicted an increase in the linear momentum of the wave on entering a dielectric medium, whereas Abraham's tensor predicted its decrease. Theoretical arguments were advanced in favour of both sides, and experiments proved incapable of distinguishing between the two. Yet more forms were proposed, each with their advocates who considered the form that they were proposing to be the one true tensor. This paper reviews the debate and its eventual conclusion: that no electromagnetic wave energy--momentum tensor is complete on its own. When the appropriate accompanying energy--momentum tensor for the material medium is also considered, experimental predictions of all the various proposed tensors will always be the same, and the preferred form is therefore effectively a matter of personal choice.",Momentum of an electromagnetic wave in dielectric media

The energy flux vector is introduced as S_e=(E x B)/mu_0 instead of E x H, because only by this choice the energy dissipation can be related to the balance of the kinetic energy of the matter subsystem. Conservation of the total energy as the sum of kinetic and electromagnetic energy follows. In our discussion, media and their microscopic nature are represented exactly by their susceptibility functions, which do not necessarily have to be known. On this footing, it can be shown that energy conservation in the propagation of light through bounded media is ensured by Maxwell's boundary conditions alone, even for some frequently used approximations.

These simplifications are based on neglecting the Minkowski tensor's material counterpart, a process known to be incompatible with conservation of angular momentum, and in conflict with experimental results, yet they are very successful in a wide range of circumstances. This paper combines existing constraints on their usage with recent theoretical analysis to obtain a list of conditions which much be satisfied to safely use the simplified Minkowski approach.

For mixed states this identification vanishes, since the global loss of information about the state makes it impossible to distinguish between quantum and classical correlations. Here we show how the joint knowledge of the global and marginal degrees of information of a quantum state, quantified by the purities or in general by information entropies, provides an accurate characterization of its entanglement. In particular, for Gaussian states of continuous variable systems, we classify the entanglement of two--mode states according to their degree of total and partial mixedness, comparing the different roles played by the purity and the generalized $p-$entropies in quantifying the mixedness and bounding the entanglement. We prove the existence of strict upper and lower bounds on the entanglement and the existence of extremally (maximally and minimally) entangled states at fixed global and marginal degrees of information. This results allow for a powerful, operative method to measure mixed-state entanglement without the full tomographic reconstruction of the state.

We first review the formalism of Gaussian measures of entanglement, adopting the framework developed in [M. M. Wolf {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 69}, 052320 (2004)], where the Gaussian entanglement of formation was defined. We compute Gaussian measures explicitely for two important families of nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian states, namely the states of extremal (maximal and minimal) negativities at fixed global and local purities, introduced in [G. Adesso {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 087901 (2004)]. This allows us to compare the {\em orderings} induced on the set of entangled two--mode Gaussian states by the negativities and by the Gaussian entanglement measures. We find that in a certain range of global and local purities (characterizing the covariance matrix of the corresponding extremal states), states of minimum negativity can have more Gaussian entanglement than states of maximum negativity. Thus Gaussian measures and negativities are definitely inequivalent on nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian states (even when restricted to extremal states), while they are completely equivalent on symmetric states, where moreover the Gaussian entanglement of formation coincides with the true one. However, the inequivalence between these two families of continuous-variable entanglement measures is somehow limited. In fact we show rigorously that, at fixed negativities, the Gaussian entanglement measures are bounded from below, and we provide strong evidence that they are also bounded from above.",Gaussian measures of entanglement versus negativities: the ordering of   two-mode Gaussian states

We measure the probability to obtain a MS packing at packing fraction $\phi$ and find several notable results. First, the probability is highly nonuniform. When averaged over narrow packing fraction intervals, the most probable MS packing occurs at the highest $\phi$ and the probability decays exponentially with decreasing $\phi$. Even more striking, within each packing-fraction interval, the probability can vary by many orders of magnitude.

387,2,0606224v1,"Relative frequencies of mechanically stable (MS) packings of frictionless bidisperse disks are studied numerically in small systems. The packings are created by successively compressing or decompressing a system of soft purely repulsive disks, followed by energy minimization, until only infinitesimal particle overlaps remain. For systems of up to 14 particles most of the MS packings were generated. We find that the packings are not equally probable as has been assumed in recent thermodynamic descriptions of granular systems. Instead, the frequency distribution, averaged over each packing-fraction interval $\Delta \phi$, grows exponentially with increasing $\phi$. Moreover, within each packing-fraction interval MS packings occur with frequencies $f_k$ that differ by many orders of magnitude. Also, key features of the frequency distribution do not change when we significantly alter the packing-generation algorithm--for example frequent packings remain frequent and rare ones remain rare. These results indicate that the frequency distribution of MS packings is strongly influenced by geometrical properties of the multidimensional configuration space. By adding thermal fluctuations to a set of the MS packings, we were able to examine a number of local features of configuration space near each packing including the time required for a given packing to break to a distinct one, which enabled us to estimate the energy barriers that separate one packing from another. We found a positive correlation between the packing frequencies and the heights of the lowest energy barriers $\epsilon_0$.

We identify convective and absolute instability regimes. Well above the incoherent threshold the coherent instability growth rate is recovered. The threshold of convective instability is inside the typical parameter region of National Ignition Facility (NIF) designs although current NIF bandwidth is not large enough to insure dominance of collective instability and suggests lower instability threshold due to speckle contribution.

In this paper we (a) argue, using simple models, that motion in curved force-fields with the typical energies used and the characteristic geometry of DNA cannot account for such observations; (b) introduce the concept of induced spin filtering, whereupon selectivity in the transmission of the electron orbital angular momentum can induce spin selectivity in the transmission process provided there is strong spin-orbit coupling in the substrate; and (c) show that the spin polarizability in the tunneling current as well as the photoemission current from gold covered by helical adsorbates can be of the observed order of magnitude. Our results can account for most of the published observations that involved gold and silver substrates, however recent results obtained with an aluminum substrate can be rationalized within the present model only if strong spin-orbit coupling is caused by the built-in electric field at the molecule-metal interface.",Induced spin filtering in electron transmission through chiral molecular   layers adsorbed on metals with strong spin-orbit coupling
389,3,1508.01882v1,"Recently, the chiral-induced spin selectivity in molecular systems has attracted extensive interest among the scientific communities. Here, we investigate the effect of the gate voltage on spin-selective electron transport through the $\alpha$-helical peptide/protein molecule contacted by two nonmagnetic electrodes. Based on an effective model Hamiltonian and the Landauer-B\""uttiker formula, we calculate the conductance and the spin polarization under an external electric field which is perpendicular to the helix axis of the $\alpha$-helical peptide/protein molecule. Our results indicate that both the magnitude and the direction of the gate field have a significant effect on the conductance and the spin polarization. The spin filtration efficiency can be improved by properly tuning the gate voltage, especially in the case of strong dephasing regime. And the spin polarization increases monotonically with the molecular length without the gate voltage, which is consistent with the recent experiment, and presents oscillating behavior in the presence of the gate voltage. In addition, the spin selectivity is robust against the dephasing, the on-site energy disorder, and the space angle disorder under the gate voltage. Our results could motivate further experimental and theoretical works on the chiral-based spin selectivity in molecular systems.",Effect of gate voltage on spin transport along $α$-helical protein
389,4,1611.01832v2,"Unlike the two-terminal device, in which the time-reversal invariant spin-orbit interaction alone cannot polarize the spins, such a polarization can be generated when electrons from one source reservoir flow into two (or more) separate drain reservoirs. We present analytical solutions for two examples. First, we demonstrate that the electrons transmitted through a ""diamond"" interferometer into two drains can be simultaneously fully spin-polarized along different tunable directions, even when the two arms of the interferometer are not identical. Second, we show that a single helical molecule attached to more than one drain can induce a significant spin polarization in electrons passing through it. The average polarization remains non-zero even when the electrons outgoing into separate leads are eventually mixed incoherently into one absorbing reservoir. This may explain recent experiments on spin selectivity of certain helical-chiral molecules.",Spin filtering in all-electrical three-terminal interferometers
389,5,1710.09582v1,"It is widely admitted that the helical conformation of certain chiral molecules may induce a sizable spin selectivity observed in experiments. Spin selectivity arises as a result of the interplay between a helicity-induced spin-orbit coupling and electric dipole fields in the molecule. From the theoretical point of view, different phenomena might affect the spin dynamics in helical molecules, such as quantum dephasing, dissipation and the role of metallic contacts. Previous studies neglected the local deformation of the molecule about the carrier thus far, but this assumption seems unrealistic to describe charge transport in molecular systems. We introduce an effective model describing the electron spin dynamics in a deformable helical molecule with weak spin-orbit coupling. We find that the electron-lattice interaction allows the formation of stable solitons such as bright solitons with well defined spin projection onto the molecule axis. We present a thorough study of these bright solitons and analyze their possible impact on the spin dynamics in deformable helical molecules.",Spin dynamics in helical molecules with non-linear interactions

390,2,0705.1425v2,"We study the elasticity of random stiff fiber networks. The elastic response of the fibers is characterized by a central force stretching stiffness as well as a bending stiffness that acts transverse to the fiber contour. Previous studies have shown that this model displays an anomalous elastic regime where the stretching mode is fully frozen out and the elastic energy is completely dominated by the bending mode. We demonstrate by simulations and scaling arguments that, in contrast to the bending dominated \emph{elastic energy}, the equally important \emph{elastic forces} are to a large extent stretching dominated. By characterizing these forces on microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales we find two mechanisms of how forces are transmitted in the network. While forces smaller than a threshold $F_c$ are effectively balanced by a homogeneous background medium, forces larger than $F_c$ are found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the sample, giving rise to highly localized force-chains known from granular media.",Force distributions and force chains in random stiff fiber networks
390,3,0807.2805v2,"We study the micromechanics of collagen-I gel with the goal of bridging the gap between theory and experiment in the study of biopolymer networks. Three-dimensional images of fluorescently labeled collagen are obtained by confocal microscopy and the network geometry is extracted using a 3d network skeletonization algorithm. Each fiber is modeled as a worm-like-chain that resists stretching and bending, and each cross-link is modeled as torsional spring. The stress-strain curves of networks at three different densities are compared to rheology measurements. The model shows good agreement with experiment, confirming that strain stiffening of collagen can be explained entirely by geometric realignment of the network, as opposed to entropic stiffening of individual fibers. The model also suggests that at small strains, cross-link deformation is the main contributer to network stiffness whereas at large strains, fiber stretching dominates. Since this modeling effort uses networks with realistic geometries, this analysis can ultimately serve as a tool for understanding how the mechanics of fibers and cross-links at the microscopic level produce the macroscopic properties of the network.

At physiological temperatures $25-45^{\circ}$C Young's modulus decreases, which can be interpreted as instability of collagen. For temperatures between $45-80^{\circ}$C Young's modulus first stabilizes and then increases with decreasing the temperature. The hydrated water content and the damping decrement have strong maxima in the interval $70-80^{\circ}$C indicating on complex inter-molecular structural changes in the fibril.

When a continuous shear strain is applied to a collagen network, we observe that the local apparent modulus, in the strain-stiffening regime, is strongly dependent on the gel thickness. In addition, we demonstrate that the overall network failure is determined by the ratio of the gel thickness to the mesh size.

This allows us to make a direct comparison of the measured lattice parameters with recent density functional theory (DFT) predictions. We find that the decrease in lattice constant observed on annealing is smaller than that predicted due to the out diffusion of interstitial Mn during annealing. The measured lattice parameters after annealing are still significantly larger than that of GaAs even in samples with very low compensation.

We revisit the habitability of oblique planets with an energy balance climate model (EBM) allowing for dynamical transitions to ice-covered snowball states as a result of ice-albedo feedback. Despite the great simplicity of our EBM, it captures reasonably well the seasonal cycle of global energetic fluxes at Earth's surface. It also performs satisfactorily against a full-physics climate model of a highly oblique Earth-like planet, in an unusual regime of circulation dominated by heat transport from the poles to the equator. Climates on oblique terrestrial planets can violate global radiative balance through much of their seasonal cycle, which limits the usefulness of simple radiative equilibrium arguments. High obliquity planets have severe climates, with large amplitude seasonal variations, but they are not necessarily more prone to global snowball transitions than low obliquity planets. We find that terrestrial planets with massive CO2 atmospheres, typically expected in the outer regions of habitable zones, can also be subject to such dynamical snowball transitions. Some of the snowball climates investigated for CO2-rich atmospheres experience partial atmospheric collapse. Since long-term CO2 atmospheric build-up acts as a climatic thermostat for habitable planets, partial CO2 collapse could limit the habitability of such planets.

The evaporation rate of water is calculated by an expression for free convection, driven by density differences between water vapor and ambient air, the condensation rate follows from the assumption that any water vapour which exceeds the local saturation pressure condenses instantly, and atmospheric transport of water vapour is approximated by instantaneous mixing. Glacial flow of ice deposits is neglected. Simulations with constant orbital parameters show that low obliquities favour deposition of ice in high latitudes and vice versa. A transient scenario driven by a computed history of orbital parameters over the last 10 million years produces essentially monotonically growing polar ice deposits during the most recent 4 million years, and a very good agreement with the observed present-day polar layered deposits. The thick polar deposits sometimes continue in thin ice deposits which extend far into the mid latitudes, which confirms the idea of ""ice ages"" at high obliquity.","MAIC-2, a latitudinal model for the Martian surface temperature,   atmospheric water transport and surface glaciation"

397,5,1012.5077v1,"We use the Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (MRAMS) to simulate lake storms on Mars, finding that intense localized precipitation will occur for lake size >=10^3 km^2. Mars has a low-density atmosphere, so deep convection can be triggered by small amounts of latent heat release. In our reference simulation, the buoyant plume lifts vapor above condensation level, forming a 20km-high optically-thick cloud. Ice grains grow to 200 microns radius and fall near (or in) the lake at mean rates up to 1.5 mm/hr water equivalent (maximum rates up to 6 mm/hr water equivalent). Because atmospheric temperatures outside the surface layer are always well below 273K, supersaturation and condensation begin at low altitudes above lakes on Mars. In contrast to Earth lake-effect storms, lake storms on Mars involve continuous precipitation, and their vertical velocities and plume heights exceed those of tropical thunderstorms on Earth. Convection does not reach above the planetary boundary layer for lakes <<10^3 km^2 or for atmospheric pressure >O(10^2) mbar. Instead, vapor is advected downwind with little cloud formation. Precipitation occurs as snow, and the daytime radiative forcing at the land surface due to plume vapor and storm clouds is too small to melt snow directly (<+10 W/m^2). However, if orbital conditions are favorable, then the snow may be seasonally unstable to melting and produce runoff to form channels. We calculate the probability of melting by running thermal models over all possible orbital conditions and weighting their outcomes by probabilities given by Laskar et al., 2004. We determine that for an equatorial vapor source, sunlight 15% fainter than at present, and snowpack with albedo 0.28 (0.35), melting may occur with 4%(0.1%) probability. This rises to 56%(12%) if the ancient greenhouse effect was modestly (6K) greater than today.",Localized precipitation and runoff on Mars
398,1,0503508v1,"We create collectively jammed (CJ) packings of 50-50 bidisperse mixtures of smooth disks in 2d using an algorithm in which we successively compress or expand soft particles and minimize the total energy at each step until the particles are just at contact. We focus on small systems in 2d and thus are able to find nearly all of the collectively jammed states at each system size. We decompose the probability $P(\phi)$ for obtaining a collectively jammed state at a particular packing fraction $\phi$ into two composite functions: 1) the density of CJ packing fractions $\rho(\phi)$, which only depends on geometry and 2) the frequency distribution $\beta(\phi)$, which depends on the particular algorithm used to create them. We find that the function $\rho(\phi)$ is sharply peaked and that $\beta(\phi)$ depends exponentially on $\phi$. We predict that in the infinite system-size limit the behavior of $P(\phi)$ in these systems is controlled by the density of CJ packing fractions--not the frequency distribution. These results suggest that the location of the peak in $P(\phi)$ when $N \to \infty$ can be used as a protocol-independent definition of random close packing.",Random close packing revisited: How many ways can we pack frictionless   disks?

We show that the suppressed packing fraction is caused by an increase of the adjacent neighbours with long bonds where the adjacent neighbours is defined on the basis of the Laguerre (radical) tessellation. For the poly-disperse systems in two and three dimensions, the packing fraction is shown to have a minimuma as a function of the poly-dispersity.

398,4,0608362v1,"We present the first study of disordered jammed hard-sphere packings in four-, five- and six-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Using a collision-driven packing generation algorithm, we obtain the first estimates for the packing fractions of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) states for space dimensions $d=4$, 5 and 6 to be $\phi_{MRJ} \simeq 0.46$, 0.31 and 0.20, respectively. To a good approximation, the MRJ density obeys the scaling form $\phi_{MRJ}= c_1/2^d+(c_2 d)/2^d$, where $c_1=-2.72$ and $c_2=2.56$, which appears to be consistent with high-dimensional asymptotic limit, albeit with different coefficients. Calculations of the pair correlation function $g_{2}(r)$ and structure factor $S(k)$ for these states show that short-range ordering appreciably decreases with increasing dimension, consistent with a recently proposed ``decorrelation principle,'' which, among othe things, states that unconstrained correlations diminish as the dimension increases and vanish entirely in the limit $d \to \infty$. As in three dimensions (where $\phi_{MRJ} \simeq 0.64$), the packings show no signs of crystallization, are isostatic, and have a power-law divergence in $g_{2}(r)$ at contact with power-law exponent $\simeq 0.4$. Across dimensions, the cumulative number of neighbors equals the kissing number of the conjectured densest packing close to where $g_{2}(r)$ has its first minimum. We obtain estimates for the freezing and melting desnities for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid-solid transition, $\phi_F \simeq 0.32$ and $\phi_M \simeq 0.39$, respectively, for $d=4$, and $\phi_F \simeq 0.19$ and $\phi_M \simeq 0.24$, respectively, for $d=5$.",Packing Hyperspheres in High-Dimensional Euclidean Spaces
398,5,0705.1482v2,"The problem of finding the asymptotic behavior of the maximal density of sphere packings in high Euclidean dimensions is one of the most fascinating and challenging problems in discrete geometry. One century ago, Minkowski obtained a rigorous lower bound that is controlled asymptotically by $1/2^d$, where $d$ is the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of the problem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement of Minkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper bounds suggest that such improvement should be possible. Using a statistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a ""test"" pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings [S. Torquato and F. H. Stillinger, Experimental Math. {\bf 15}, 307 (2006)], the putative exponential improvement was found with an asymptotic behavior controlled by $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$. Using the same methods, we investigate whether this exponential improvement can be further improved by exploring other test pair correlation functions correponding to disordered packings. We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions that lead to the same asymptotic result. More importantly, we show that there is a wide class of test functions that lead to precisely the same exponential improvement and therefore the asymptotic form $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$ is much more general than previously surmised.",Estimates of the optimal density and kissing number of sphere packings   in high dimensions

We now confirm our earlier identification of these features with C$_{60}$ by detecting a third emission feature at 7.04 $\pm$ 0.05 $\mu$m in NGC 7023.

The observed features in NGC 7023 are consistent with emission from UV-excited gas-phase C$_{60}$.

We report the simultaneous detection of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fullerenes towards C-rich and H-containing PNe belonging to environments with very different chemical histories such as our own Galaxy and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

We find linear growth laws for surface geometry in both horizontal and vertical directions, and measure the thickness of the active surface layer, which is shown to anti-correlate with roughness. Flow is shown to monotonically reduce surface roughness without affecting the thickness of the active layer. We argue that the rapid roughening is due to non-local surface interactions mediated by the nutrient field, which are curtailed when advection competes with diffusion.

We simulate the fluid-structure interaction and separation process using the immersed boundary method. In these simulations we model and simulate different density and viscosity values of the biofilm than that of the surrounding fluid. The simulation also includes breakable springs connecting the bacteria in the biofilm. This allows the inclusion of erosion and detachment into the simulation. We use the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations to describe the motion of the flowing fluid. We discretize the fluid equations using finite differences and use a geometric multigrid method to solve the resulting equations at each time step. The use of multigrid is necessary because of the dramatically different densities and viscosities between the biofilm and the surrounding fluid. We investigate and simulate the model in both two and three dimensions.   Our method differs from previous attempts of using IBM for modeling biofilm/flow interactions in the following ways: the density and viscosity of the biofilm can differ from the surrounding fluid, and the Lagrangian node locations correspond to experimentally measured bacterial cell locations from 3D images taken of Staphylococcus epidermidis in a biofilm.",Spatially Heterogeneous Biofilm Simulations using an Immersed Boundary   Method with Lagrangian Nodes Defined by Bacterial Locations

In particular, we find that the velocity depends on the elastic modulus of bacteria or their stickiness to the surface.

We find that under normal conditions the stress concentration is insufficient to mechanically rupture bacteria, even for gaps up to a micron in length. We then explored the effects of stress-dependent smart-autolysins, as hypothesised by Arthur L Koch [Advances in Microbial Physiology 24, 301 (1983); Research in Microbiology 141, 529 (1990)]. We show that the measured anisotropic elasticity of the PG sacculus can lead to stable circumferential propagation of small gaps in the sacculus. This is consistent with the recent observation of circumferential propagation of PG-associated MreB patches in rod-shaped bacteria. We also find a bistable regime of both circumferential and axial gap propagation, which agrees with behavior reported in cytoskeletal mutants of B. subtilis.

401,2,0601043v2,"Using coarse-grained model we have explored forced-unfolding of RNA hairpin as a function of $f_S$ and the loading rate ($r_f$). The simulations and theoretical analysis have been done without and with the handles that are explicitly modeled by semiflexible polymer chains. The mechanisms and time scales for denaturation by temperature jump and mechanical unfolding are vastly different. The directed perturbation of the native state by $f_S$ results in a sequential unfolding of the hairpin starting from their ends whereas thermal denaturation occurs stochastically. From the dependence of the unfolding rates on $r_f$ and $f_S$ we show that the position of the unfolding transition state (TS) is not a constant but moves dramatically as either $r_f$ or $f_S$ is changed. The TS movements are interpreted by adopting the Hammond postulate for forced-unfolding. Forced-unfolding simulations of RNA, with handles attached to the two ends, show that the value of the unfolding force increases (especially at high pulling speeds) as the length of the handles increases. The pathways for refolding of RNA from stretched initial conformation, upon quenching $f_S$ to the quench force $f_Q$, are highly heterogeneous. The refolding times, upon force quench, are at least an order of magnitude greater than those obtained by temperature quench. The long $f_Q$-dependent refolding times starting from fully stretched states are analyzed using a model that accounts for the microscopic steps in the rate limiting step which involves the trans to gauche transitions of the dihedral angles in the GAAA tetraloop. The simulations with explicit molecular model for the handles show that the dynamics of force-quench refolding is strongly dependent on the interplay of their contour length and the persistence length, and the RNA persistence length.",Forced-unfolding and force-quench refolding of RNA hairpins

The present approach extends the range of validity of the two-states approximation by providing a theoretical framework to reconstruct free-energy landscapes and identify force-induced structural changes in molecular transition states using single molecule pulling experiments.

The model includes different elements of the experimental setup (beads, handles and RNA sequence) and limitations of the instrument (time lag of the force-feedback mechanism and finite bandwidth of data acquisition). We investigated the influence of the instrument on the measured hopping rates. Results from the model are in good agreement with the experiments reported in the companion article (1). The comparison between theory and experiments allowed us to infer the values of the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal experimental conditions to do the measurements.

402,1,1808.05949v3,"Starting from a state of low quantum entanglement, local unitary time evolution increases the entanglement of a quantum many-body system. In contrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees of freedom and decrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by considering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We begin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that measurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement, in contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary time evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement for any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show that more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law transition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with recent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we analytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit an entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size distributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed points.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on the order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any non-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an area law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that a system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law entanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which provides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement phase. Note: The results presented here supersede those of all previous versions of this manuscript, which contained some erroneous claims.",Unitary-projective entanglement dynamics

We simulate a large class of Clifford circuits, including models with or without randomness in the unitary gates, and with or without randomness in the locations of measurement gates, using stabilizer techniques to access the long time dynamics of systems up to 512 qubits. In all models we find a volume law entangled phase for low measurement rates, which exhibits a sub-dominant logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy, $S_A = {\alpha} \ln |A| + s|A|$, with sub-system size $|A|$. With increasing measurement rate the volume law phase is unstable to a disentangled area law phase, passing through a single entanglement transition at a critical rate of measurement. At criticality we find a purely logarithmic entanglement entropy, $S_A = {\alpha}(p_c) \ln|A|$, a power law decay and conformal symmetry of the mutual information, with exponential decay off criticality. Various spin-spin correlation functions also show slow decay at criticality. Critical exponents are consistent across all models, indicative of a single universality class.

The behavior is then compared to the genuine multipartite entanglement obtained in random matrix product states with a moderately high bond dimension. We then relate the behavior of multipartite entanglement to other global properties of the system, viz. the delocalization of the many-body wavefunctions in Hilbert space.

In order to reach this sensitivity the background rate has to be understood and minimised to 0.01 counts per second. One of the background sources is the unavoidable Penning trap for electrons due to the combination of the electric and magnetic fields between the pre- and the main spectrometer at KATRIN. In this article we will show that by sweeping a conducting wire periodically through such a particle trap stored particles can be removed, an ongoing discharge in the trap can be stopped, and the count rate measured with a detector looking at the trap is reduced.",Effect of a sweeping conductive wire on electrons stored in the Penning   trap between the KATRIN spectrometers
404,4,1011.6365v1,"The method of direct neutrino mass determination based on the kinematics of tritium beta decay, which is adopted by the KATRIN experiment, makes use of a large, high-resolution electrostatic spectrometer with magnetic adiabatic collimation. In order to target a sensitivity on the neutrino mass of 0.2 eV/c^2, a detailed understanding of the electromagnetic properties of the electron spectrometer is essential, requiring comprehensive calibration measurements with dedicated electron sources. In this paper we report on a prototype of a photoelectron source providing a narrow energy spread and angular selectivity. Both are key properties for the characterisation of the spectrometer. The angular selectivity is achieved by applying non-parallel strong electric and magnetic fields: Directly after being created, photoelectrons are accelerated rapidly and non-adiabatically by a strong electric field before adiabatic magnetic guiding takes over.",Prototype of an angular-selective photoelectron calibration source for   the KATRIN experiment

In order to reach this sensitivity, a low background level of 0.01 counts per second (cps) is required. This paper describes how the decay of radon in a MAC-E filter generates background events, based on measurements performed at the KATRIN pre-spectrometer test setup. Radon (Rn) atoms, which emanate from materials inside the vacuum region of the KATRIN spectrometers, are able to penetrate deep into the magnetic flux tube so that the alpha-decay of Rn contributes to the background. Of particular importance are electrons emitted in processes accompanying the Rn alpha-decay, such as shake-off, internal conversion of excited levels in the Rn daughter atoms and Auger electrons. While low-energy electrons (< 100 eV) directly contribute to the background in the signal region, higher energy electrons can be stored magnetically inside the volume of the spectrometer. Depending on their initial energy, they are able to create thousands of secondary electrons via subsequent ionization processes with residual gas molecules and, since the detector is not able to distinguish these secondary electrons from the signal electrons, an increased background rate over an extended period of time is generated.",Radon induced background processes in the KATRIN pre-spectrometer

406,4,1212.5252v2,"In early 1995, a DSM pilot initiative has been launched in the French islands of Guadeloupe and Reunion through a partnership between several public and private partners (the French Public Utility EDF, the University of Reunion Island, low cost housing companies, architects, energy consultants, etc...) to set up standards to improve thermal design of new residential buildings in tropical climates. This partnership led to defining optimized bio-climatic urban planning and architectural designs featuring the use of passive cooling architectural principles (solar shading, natural ventilation) and components, as well as energy efficient systems and technologies. The design and sizing of each architectural component on internal thermal comfort in building has been assessed with a validated thermal and airflow building simulation software (CODYRUN). These technical specifications have been edited in a reference document which has been used to build over 300 new pilot dwellings through the years 1996-1998 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe. An experimental monitoring has been made in these first ECODOM dwellings in 1998 and 1999. It will result in experimental validation of impact of the passive cooling strategies on thermal comfort of occupants leading to modify specifications if necessary.

406,5,1212.5254v1,"A bioclimatic approach to designing comfortable buildings in hot and humid tropical regions requires, firstly, some preliminary, important work on the building envelope to limit the energy contributions, and secondly, an airflow optimization of the building. For the first step, tools such as nodal or zonal models have been largely implemented. For the second step, the assessment of air velocities, in three dimensions and in a large space, can only be performed through the use of detailed models such as with CFD. This paper deals with the improvement of thermal comfort by ventilating around the occupants. For this purpose, the average velocity coefficient definition is modified to be adapted to CFD and the areas involving movement or the living spaces. We propose a new approach based on the derivation of a new quantity: the well-ventilated percentage of a living space. The well-ventilated percentage of a space allows a time analysis of the aeraulic behaviour of the building in its environment. These percentages can be over a period such as one day, a season or a year. These kinds of results are helpful for an architect to configure the rooms of a house according to their uses, the environment, the architectural choices and the constraints related to the design of bioclimatic buildings.","A numerical approach to evaluating what percentage of a living space is   well-ventilated, for the assessment of thermal comfort"

The calculations were carried out by means of the MZ code based on the Z-expansion method. Relativistic corrections were taken into account within the framework of the Breit operator. The main difference with previous calculations by MZ code consists in accounting for the first order corrections in powers of 1/Z, corresponding to the screening effects, in calculations of autoionization rates. New data for comparatively large rates are about 20-50% less as compared to previous ones and are in a agreement within 10% with the results of calculations made by the methods based on multi-configuration wave functions with non-relativistic and relativistic orbitals.

408,3,0905.1662v1,"A general and rigorous methodology to compute the quantum equilibrium isotope effect is described. Unlike standard approaches, ours does not assume separability of rotational and vibrational motions and does not make the harmonic approximation for vibrations or rigid rotor approximation for the rotations. In particular, zero point energy and anharmonicity effects are described correctly quantum mechanically. The approach is based on the thermodynamic integration with respect to the mass of isotopes and on the Feynman path integral representation of the partition function. An efficient estimator for the derivative of free energy is used whose statistical error is independent of the number of imaginary time slices in the path integral, speeding up calculations by a factor of 60 at 500 K. We describe the implementation of the methodology in the molecular dynamics package Amber 10. The method is tested on three [1,5] sigmatropic hydrogen shift reactions. Because of the computational expense, we use ab initio potentials to evaluate the equilibrium isotope effects within the harmonic approximation, and then the path integral method together with semiempirical potentials to evaluate the anharmonicity corrections. Our calculations show that the anharmonicity effects amount up to 30% of the symmetry reduced reaction free energy.

408,4,0910.1150v1,"We consider the role of quantum effects in the transfer of hyrogen-like species in enzyme-catalysed reactions. This study is stimulated by claims that the observed magnitude and temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects imply that quantum tunneling below the energy barrier associated with the transition state significantly enhances the reaction rate in many enzymes. We use a path integral approach which provides a general framework to understand tunneling in a quantum system which interacts with an environment at non-zero temperature. Here the quantum system is the active site of the enzyme and the environment is the surrounding protein and water. Tunneling well below the barrier only occurs for temperatures less than a temperature $T_0$ which is determined by the curvature of potential energy surface near the top of the barrier. We argue that for most enzymes this temperature is less than room temperature. For physically reasonable parameters quantum transition state theory gives a quantitative description of the temperature dependence and magnitude of kinetic isotope effects for two classes of enzymes which have been claimed to exhibit signatures of quantum tunneling. The only quantum effects are those associated with the transition state, both reflection at the barrier top and tunneling just below the barrier. We establish that the friction due to the environment is weak and only slightly modifies the reaction rate. Furthermore, at room temperature and for typical energy barriers environmental degrees of freedom with frequencies much less than 1000 cm$^{-1}$ do not have a significant effect on quantum corrections to the reaction rate.",Quantum Transition State Theory for proton transfer reactions in enzymes

The methodology is applied to the [1,5] sigmatropic hydrogen shift in pentadiene. Both the KIE and the temperature dependence of the rate constant confirm the importance of tunneling and other nuclear quantum effects as well as of the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface.

At the highest energies the detailed simulation of air showers is very costly in processing time and disk space due to the large number of secondary particles generated in interactions with the atmosphere, e.g. $\sim 10^{11}$ for $10^{20}$ eV proton shower. Therefore, in order to increase the statistics, it is quite common to recycle single showers many times to simulate the detector response. In this work we present a detailed study of the artificial effects introduced by the multiple use of single air showers for the detector simulations.

On the other hand, bulk MoS2 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor similar to silicon, with a gap of 1.2 eV, and therefore deterministic preparation of single MoS2 layers is a crucial step towards exploiting the large direct bandgap of monolayer MoS2 in electronic, optoelectronic, and photovoltaic applications. Although mechanical and chemical exfoliation methods can be used to obtain high quality MoS2 single-layers, the lack of control in the thickness, shape, size, and position of the flakes limits their usefulness.

412,3,1309.1455v1,"Ultra-thin planar heterostructures of graphene and other two-dimensional crystals have recently attracted much interest. Very high carrier mobility in a graphene-on-boron nitride assembly is now well-established, but it has been anticipated that appropriately designed hybrids could perform other tasks as well. A heterostructure of graphene and molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) is expected to be sensitive to photo illumination due to the optical bandgap in MoS$_2$. Despite significant advances in device architectures with both graphene and MoS$_2$, binary graphene-MoS$_2$ hybrids have not been realized so far, and the promising opto-electronic properties of such structures remain elusive. Here we demonstrate experimentally that graphene-on-MoS$_2$ binary heterostructures display an unexpected and remarkable persistent photoconductivity under illumination of white light. The photoconductivity can not only be tuned independently with both light intensity and back gate voltage, but in response to a suitable combination of light and gate voltage pulses the device functions as a re-writable optoelectronic switch or memory. The persistent, or `ON', state shows virtually no relaxation or decay within the the experimental time scales for low and moderate photoexcitation intensity, indicating a near-perfect charge retention. A microscopic model associates the persistence with strong localization of carriers in MoS$_2$. These effects are also observable at room temperature, and with chemical vapour deposited graphene, and hence are naturally scalable for large area applications.",A nearly relaxation-free opto-electronic memory from ultra-thin   graphene-MoS$_2$ binary hybrids
412,4,1310.4012v1,"Recent dramatic progress in studying various two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals and their heterostructures calls for better and more detailed understanding of their crystallography, reconstruction, stacking order, etc. For this, direct imaging and identification of each and every atom is essential. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) are ideal, and perhaps the only tools for such studies. However, the electron beam can in some cases induce dramatic structure changes and radiation damage becomes an obstacle in obtaining the desired information in imaging and chemical analysis in the (S)TEM. This is the case of 2D materials such as molybdenum disulfide MoS2, but also of many biological specimens, molecules and proteins. Thus, minimizing damage to the specimen is essential for optimum microscopic analysis. In this letter we demonstrate, on the example of MoS2, that encapsulation of such crystals between two layers of graphene allows for a dramatic improvement in stability of the studied 2D crystal, and permits careful control over the defect nature and formation in it. We present STEM data collected from single layer MoS2 samples prepared for observation in the microscope through three distinct procedures. The fabricated single layer MoS2 samples were either left bare (pristine), placed atop a single-layer of graphene or finally encapsulated between single graphene layers. Their behaviour under the electron beam is carefully compared and we show that the MoS2 sample 'sandwiched' between the graphene layers has the highest durability and lowest defect formation rate compared to the other two samples, for very similar experimental conditions.",Control of Radiation Damage in MoS2 by Graphene Encapsulation

414,3,1305.0804v3,"We investigate theoretically the effect of injection of plasmonic carriers from an optically-excited metal nanocrystal to a semiconductor contact or to attached molecules. The distributions of optically-excited hot carriers are dramatically different in metal nanocrystals with large and small sizes. In large nanocrystals, most carriers have very small energies and the hot carrier distribution resembles the case of a plasmon wave in bulk. In nanocrystals smaller than 20nm, the carrier distribution extends to larger energies and occupies the whole region E_{F}<E<omega. The physical reason for the above behaviors is non-conservation of momentum in a nanocrystal. Because of the above properties, nanocrystals of small sizes are most suitable for designing of opto-electronic and photosynthetic devices based on injection of plasmonic electrons and holes. The central parameter of the problem is DeltaN=omega/q_{L}*v_{F}, where q_{L} is the momentum transfer and v_{F} is the Fermi velocity. In gold nanocrystals, when DeltaN<7, the high-energy hot-electron generation is efficient. For larger parameters DeltaN, the number of high-energy electrons is greatly reduced. Another important factor is the polarization of the exciting light. For efficient excitation of carriers with high energies, the electric-field polarization vector should be perpendicular to a prism-like nanoantenna (slab or platelet) with a small width ~ 10-20 nm. We also show the relation between our theory for injection in plasmonic nanocrystals and the Fowler theory of injection from a bulk metal. Along with a prism geometry (or platelet geometry), we consider cubes. The results can be applied to design both purely solid-state opto-electronic devices and systems for photo-catalysis and solar conversion.",Theory of photo-injection of hot plasmonic carriers in   metal-semiconductor nanostructures

We consider two mechanisms of the photoelectric effect from nanoparticles - surface and volume ones, and use models of these two effects which allow us to obtain analytical results for the photoelectron emission rates from nanoparticle. Calculations have been done for the step potential at surface of spherical nanoparticle, and the simple model for the hot electron cooling have been used. We highlight the effect of the discontinuity of the dielectric permittivity at the nanoparticle boundary in the surface mechanism, which leads to substantial (by 5 times) increase of photoelectron emission rate from nanoparticle compared to the case when such discontinuity is absent. For plasmonic nanoparticle, a comparison of two mechanisms of the photoeffect was done for the first time and showed that surface photoeffect, at least, does not concede the volume one, which agrees with results for the flat metal surface first formulated by Tamm and Schubin in their pioneering development of quantum-mechanical theory of photoeffect in 1931. In accordance with our calculations, this predominance of the surface effect is a result of effective cooling of hot carriers, during their propagation from volume of the nanoparticle to its surface in the scenario of the volume mechanism.

The analysis of forces acting between the iron particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.,Towards understanding of birds magnetoreceptor mechanism

In the regime of low magnetic fields we describe the appearance of purely quantum phenomena, that fade away as the magnetic field increases. We will analyze the magnetic sensitivity of these reactions under this perspective and bridge the new full quantum theory with the existing classical reaction theory applicable at high magnetic fields. Based on the quantum theory of recombination we will then explain experimental observations incompatible with classical reaction theory, in particular the effect of deuteration on the magnetic sensitivity of radical-ion pair recombination yields.",Quantum Theory of Radical-Ion-Pair Recombination: A New Physical   Paradigm for Low-Magnetic-Field Effects

Recent experiments with magnetic-sensitive radical-ion pair reactions provided strong evidence for the radical-ion-pair magnetoreception mechanism, verifying the expected magnetic sensitivities and chemical product yield changes. It is here shown that the theoretical description of radical-ion-pair reactions used since the 70's cannot explain the observed data, because it is based on phenomenological equations masking quantum coherence effects.

It is found that fracture in the nanocomposites, under tensile or shear load, occurs inter-grain and so their ideal strength is similar to the pure amorphous phase.

In particular, we show that a particular class of bond-order potentials (the so-called LCBOP models) account well for many of the known structural and thermodynamic properties of carbon at high pressures and temperatures. We discuss the LCBOP models in some detail. In addition, we briefly review the ``history'' of experimental and theoretical studies of the phase behaviour of carbon. Using a well-tested version of the LCBOP model (viz.

420,5,0907.2052v1,"Diamonds melt at temperatures above 4000 K. There are no measurements of the steady-state rate of the reverse process: diamond nucleation from the melt, because experiments are difficult at these extreme temperatures and pressures. Using numerical simulations, we estimate the diamond nucleation rate and find that it increases by many orders of magnitude when the pressure is increased at constant supersaturation. The reason is that an increase in pressure changes the local coordination of carbon atoms from three-fold to four-fold. It turns out to be much easier to nucleate diamond in a four-fold coordinated liquid than in a liquid with three-fold coordination, because in the latter case the free-energy cost to create a diamond-liquid interface is higher. We speculate that this mechanism for nucleation control is relevant for crystallization in many network-forming liquids. On the basis of our calculations, we conclude that homogeneous diamond nucleation is likely in carbon-rich stars and unlikely in gaseous planets.",Local structure of liquid carbon controls diamond nucleation

The spectral shape of the noise at the relevant high frequencies is found to be very stable for an extensive data set collected over several months from 49 hydrophones mounted near the bottom of the ocean at ~1600 m depth. The slopes of the ambient noise spectra above 15 kHz are found to roll-off faster than the -6 dB/octave seen in Knudsen spectra. A model attributing the source to an uniform distribution of surface noise that includes frequency-dependent absorption at large depth is found to fit the data well up to 25 kHz.

We show that his consideration is based on the erroneous overestimation of the fluctuation energy which comes from the interaction of the Goldstone modes with the frozen disorder. This interaction leads to the Imry-Ma effect, which destroys the orientational order, but is unable to destroy the local structure of the A-phase.

The electrical analogs are discussed in conductors subject to high magnetic fields where electron motion is along edge states. The transport quantities are modulated with the help of an Aharonov-Bohm flux. We discuss the conductance (current) visibility and shot noise visibility as a function of temperature and applied voltage. Dephasing is introduced with the help of fictitious voltage probes. Comparison of these two interferometers is of interest since the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is an amplitude (single-particle) interferometer whereas the Hanbury Brown Twiss interferometer is an intensity (two-particle) interferometer. A direct comparison is only possible for the shot noise of the two interferometers. We find that the visibility of shot noise correlations of the Hanbury Brown Twiss interferometer as function of temperature, voltage or dephasing, is qualitatively similar to the visibility of the first harmonic of the shot noise correlation of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In contrast, the second harmonic of the shot noise visibility of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer decreases much more rapidly with increasing temperature, voltage or dephasing rate.",Visibility of current and shot noise in electrical Mach-Zehnder and   Hanbury Brown Twiss interferometers

The beauty of this experiment lies in the simplicity of two path interference. Electrons that travel the two paths via edge channels, feel only the edge potential and the strong magnetic field; both typical in the IQHE regime. Yet, the interference of these electrons via the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect, behaves surprisingly in a most uncommon way.   We found, at filling factors 1 and 2, high visibility interference oscillations, which were strongly modulated by a lobe-type structure as we increased the electron injection voltage. The visibility went through a few maxima and zeros in between, with the phase of the AB oscillations staying constant throughout each lobe and slipping abruptly by at each zero. The lobe pattern and the 'stick-slip' behavior of the phase were insensitive to details of the interferometer structure; but highly sensitive to magnetic field. The observed periodicity defines a 'new energy scale' with an unclear origin. The phase rigidity, on the other hand, is surprising since Onsager relations are not relevant here.",Coherence and Phase in an Electronic Mach-Zehnder Interferometer: An   Unexpected Behavior of Interfering Electrons

A simple model is used to bring out some of the basic physics of a class of field emitter where quantum confinement effects exist transverse to the emitting direction. A high-level methodology is presented for developing CFE equations more general than the usual Fowler-Nordheim-type (FN-type) equations, and is applied to the classical nanowall. If the nanowall is sufficiently thin, then significant transverse-energy quantization effects occur, and affect the overall form of theoretical CFE equations; also, the tunnelling barrier shape exhibits ""fall-off"" in the local field value with distance from the surface.

430,2,1111.7298v3,"In papers on cold field electron emission from large area field emitters (LAFEs), it has become widespread practice to publish a misleading Fowler-Nordheim-type (FN-type) equation. This equation over-predicts the LAFE-average current density by a large highly-variable factor thought to usually lie between 1000 and 1000 000 000. This equation, although often referenced to FN's 1928 paper, is a simplified equation used in undergraduate teaching, does not apply unmodified to LAFEs, and does not appear in the 1928 paper. Technological LAFE papers often do not cite any theoretical work more recent than 1928, and often do not comment on the discrepancy between theory and experiment. This usage has occurred widely, in several high-profile American and UK applied-science journals, and in various other places. It does not inhibit practical LAFE development, but can give a misleading impression of potential LAFE performance to non-experts. This paper shows how the misleading equation can be replaced by a conceptually complete FN-type equation that uses three high-level correction factors. One of these, or a combination of two of them, may be useful as an additional measure of LAFE quality; this paper describes how to estimate factor values using experimental data. Suggestions are made for improved engineering practice in reporting LAFE results. Some of these should help to prevent situations arising whereby an equation appearing in high-profile applied-science journals is used to support statements that an engineering regulatory body might deem to involve professional negligence.","Extraction of emission parameters for large-area field emitters, using a   technically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation"
430,3,1208.3820v3,"This article introduces an improved approach to Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plot analysis, based on a new type of intercept correction factor. This factor is more cleanly defined than the factor previously used. General enabling theory is given that applies to any type of FN plot of data that can be fitted using a FN-type equation. Practical use is limited to emission situations where slope correction factors can be reliably predicted. By making a series of well-defined assumptions and approximations, it is shown how the general formulas reduce to provide an improved theory of orthodox FN-plot data analysis. This applies to situations where the circuit current is fully controlled by the emitter characteristics, and tunneling can be treated as taking place through a Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier. For orthodox emission, good working formulas make numerical evaluation of the slope correction factor and the new intercept correction factor quick and straightforward. A numerical illustration, using simulated emission data, shows how to use this improved approach to derive values for parameters in the full FN-type equation for the SN barrier. Good self-consistency is demonstrated. The general enabling formulas also pave the way for research aimed at developing analogous data-analysis procedures for non-orthodox emission situations.",Improved approach to Fowler-Nordheim plot analysis
430,4,1208.4735v3,"This technical note relates to the theory of cold field electron emission (CFE). It starts by suggesting that, to emphasize common properties in relation to CFE theory, the term 'Lauritsen plot' could be used to describe all graphical plots made with the reciprocal of barrier field (or the reciprocal of a quantity proportional to barrier field) on the horizontal axis. It then argues that Lauritsen plots related to barrier strength (G) and transmission probability (D) could play a useful role in discussion of CFE theory. Such plots would supplement conventional Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots. All these plots would be regarded as particular types of Lauritsen plot. The Lauritsen plots of -G and lnD can be used to illustrate how basic aspects of FN tunnelling theory are influenced by the mathematical form of the tunnelling barrier. These, in turn, influence local emission current density and emission current. Illustrative applications used in this note relate to the well-known exact triangular and Schottky-Nordheim barriers, and to the Coulomb barrier (i.e., the electrostatic component of the electron potential energy barrier outside a model spherical emitter). For the Coulomb barrier, a good analytical series approximation has been found for the barrier-form correction factor; this can be used to predict the existence (and to some extent the properties) of related curvature in FN plots.",Illustrating field emission theory by using Lauritsen plots of   transmission probability and barrier strength
430,5,1209.6611v1,"This paper describes a simple quantitative test applicable to current-voltage data for cold field electron emission (CFE). It can decide whether individual reported field-enhancement-factor (FEF) values are spuriously large. The paper defines an ""orthodox emission situation"" by a set of ideal experimental, physical and mathematical conditions, and shows how (in these conditions) operating values of scaled barrier field (f) can be extracted from Fowler-Nordheim (FN) and Millikan-Lauritsen (ML) plots. By analyzing historical CFE experiments, which are expected to nearly satisfy the orthodoxy conditions, ""apparently reasonable"" and ""clearly unreasonable"" experimental ranges for f are found. These provide a test for lack of orthodoxy. For illustration, this test is applied to 17 post-1975 CFE data sets, mainly for carbon and semiconductor nanostructures. Some extracted f-value ranges are apparently reasonable (including many carbon results), some are clearly unreasonable. It is shown that this test applies to any field-emission diode geometry and any form of FN or ML plot. It is proved mathematically that, if the extracted f-value range is ""unreasonably high"", then FEF-values extracted by the usual literature method are spuriously large. Probably, all new field-emitter materials should be tested in this way.

Here a periodic array of interacting streamer discharges in a strong homogeneous electric field is studied in PDE approximation in two dimensions. If the period of the streamer array is small enough, the streamers do not branch, but approach uniform translation. When the streamers are close to the branching regime, the enhanced field at the tip of the streamer is close to $2 E_{\infty}$, where $E_{\infty}$ is the homogeneous field applied between the electrodes. We discuss a moving boundary approximation to the set of PDEs. This moving boundary model turns out to be essentially the same as the one for two-fluid Hele-Shaw flows. In two dimensions, this model possesses a known analytical solution. The shape of the 2D interacting streamers in uniform motion obtained from the PDE simulations is actually well fitted by the analytically known ``selected Saffman-Taylor finger''.

We have found that the solvation properties of this system strongly depend on the size of the $^4$He droplet. For small drops, Mg resides in a deep surface state, whereas for large size drops it is fully solvated but radially delocalized in their interior. We have studied the $3s3p$ $^1$P$_1 \leftarrow 3s^2$ $^1$S$_0$ transition of the dopant, and have compared our results with experimental data from laser induced fluorescence (LIF). Line broadening effects due to the coupling of dynamical deformations of the surrounding helium with the dipole excitation of the impurity are explicitly taken into account. We show that the Mg radial delocalization inside large droplets may help reconcile the apparently contradictory solvation properties of magnesium as provided by LIF and electron-impact ionization experiments. The structure of $^4$He drops doped with two magnesium atoms is also studied and used to interpret the results of resonant two-photon-ionization (R2PI) and LIF experiments. We have found that the two solvated Mg atoms do not easily merge into a dimer, but rather form a weakly-bound state due to the presence of an energy barrier caused by the helium environment that keep them some 9.5 \AA{} apart, preventing the formation of the Mg$_2$ molecule. From this observation, we suggest that Mg atoms in $^4$He drops may form, under suitable conditions, a soft ``foam''-like aggregate rather than coalesce into a compact metallic cluster.

435,2,0911.3635v2,"The original motivation to build a quantum computer came from Feynman who envisaged a machine capable of simulating generic quantum mechanical systems, a task that is believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a machine would have a wide range of applications in the simulation of many-body quantum physics, including condensed matter physics, chemistry, and high energy physics. Part of Feynman's challenge was met by Lloyd who showed how to approximately decompose the time-evolution operator of interacting quantum particles into a short sequence of elementary gates, suitable for operation on a quantum computer. However, this left open the problem of how to simulate the equilibrium and static properties of quantum systems. This requires the preparation of ground and Gibbs states on a quantum computer. For classical systems, this problem is solved by the ubiquitous Metropolis algorithm, a method that basically acquired a monopoly for the simulation of interacting particles. Here, we demonstrate how to implement a quantum version of the Metropolis algorithm on a quantum computer. This algorithm permits to sample directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and thus evades the sign problem present in classical simulations. A small scale implementation of this algorithm can already be achieved with today's technology",Quantum Metropolis Sampling

The results show how the ordering of the hydrogen bonding breaks down in the tetrahedral network of ice with entropy increase in agreement with the neutron diffraction data. We also calculated the phonon spectra of ice in a 3x1x1 supercell by using the direct method. So far, due to the direct method used in this calculation, the phonon spectra is obtained without taking into account the effect of polarization arising from dipole-dipole interactions of water molecules which is expected to yield the splitting of longitudinal and transverse optic modes at the Gamma-point. The calculated longitudinal acoustic velocities from the initial slopes of the acoustic mode is in a reasonable agreement with the neutron scatering data.

We observe a phase transition between 230K and 268K in the nanotube data. The high momentum tail is present in the higher temperature measurement, which resembles that of ice Ih at the same temperature.

A nonlinear lattice of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-type or Lennard-Jones-type system is connected at both ends to thermal baths which are held at the same temperature on temporal average. We study two different modulations of the heat bath temperatures, namely: (i) a symmetric, harmonic ac-driving of temperature of one heat bath only and (ii) a harmonic mixing drive of temperature acting on both heat baths. While for case (i) an adiabatic result for the net heat transport can be derived in terms of the temperature dependent heat conductivity of the nonlinear lattice a similar such transport approach fails for the harmonic mixing case (ii). Then, for case (ii), not even the sign of the resulting Brownian motion induced heat flux can be predicted a priori. A non-vanishing heat flux (including a non-adiabatic reversal of flux) is detected which is the result of an induced dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism in conjunction with the nonlinearity of the lattice dynamics. Computer simulations demonstrate that the heat flux is robust against an increase of lattice sizes.

With increase in the temperature, the critical field $B^*$ increases and the temperature dependence of $B^*$ satisfies quadratic behavior which is attributed to the Landau level splitting of the linear energy dispersion.

We find that the magnetoresistance is highly asymmetric in positive and negative magnetic fields for small angles between the magnetic field and the direction perpendicular to the plane of the sample. The magnetoresistance becomes symmetric as the angle approaches 90 degree. The quantum Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations are symmetric and show signatures of topological surface states with Dirac dispersion in the form of non-zero Berry phase. However, the angular dependence of these oscillations suggests a complex three dimensional Fermi surface as the source of these oscillations, which does not exactly conform with the six ellipsoidal model of the Fermi surface of Bi2Te3. We attribute the asymmetry in the magnetoresistance to a mixing of the Hall voltage in the longitudinal resistance due to the comparable magnitude of the Hall and longitudinal resistance in our samples. This provides a clue to understanding the asymmetric magnetoresistance often seen in this and similar materials. Moreover, the asymmetric nature evolves with exposure to atmosphere and thermal cycling, which we believe is either due to exposure to atmosphere or thermal cycling, or both affecting the carrier concentration and hence the Hall signal in these samples. However, the quantum oscillations seem to be robust against these factors which suggests that the two have different origins.",Quantum oscillations with non-zero Berry phase from a complex three   dimensional Fermi surface in Bi2Te3
438,4,1601.02062v1,"Several prominent transport properties have been identified as key signatures of topologicalmaterials. One is the resistivity plateau at low temperatures as observed in several topological insulators (TIs), another is the negative magnetoresistance (MR) when the applied magnetic field is parallel to the current direction as observed in several topological semimetals (TSMs) including Dirac semimetals (DSMs) and Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Usually, these two exotic phenomena emerge in distinct materials with or without time reversal symmetry (TRS), respectively. Here we report the discovery of a new member in TSMs, TaSb2, which clearly exhibits both of these phenomena in a single material. This compound crystallizes in a base-centered monoclinic, centrosymmetric structure, and is metallic with a low carrier density in the zero field. While applying magnetic field it exhibits insulating behavior before appearance of a resistivity plateau below Tc =13 K. In the plateau regime, the ultrahigh carrier mobility and extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) for the field perpendicular to the current are observed as in DSMs and WSMs, in addition to a quantum oscillation behavior with non-trivial Berry phases. In contrast to the most known DSMs and WSMs, the negative MR in TaSb2 does not saturate up to 9 T, which, together with the almost linear Hall resistivity, manifests itself an electron-hole non-compensated TMS. These findings indicate that the resistivity plateau could be a generic feature of topology-protected metallic states even in the absence of TRS and compatible with the negative MR depending on the field direction.

Here, we study the magnetotransport properties and electronic structure of LaBi, isostructural to LaSb. LaBi exhibits large MR as in LaSb, which can be ascribed to the nearly compensated electron and hole with rather high mobilities. More importantly, our analysis suggests that the XMR as well as field-induced resistivity upturn and plateau observed in LaSb and LaBi can be well explained by the two-band model with the compensation situation.

Next we made frequency sweeps of 400Hz, centered at similar frequencies, which greatly enhanced the dip. But, with a bunched proton beam, both the fixed-frequency and frequency-sweep techniques produced similar maps, and both bunched maps showed full beam depolarization over a wide region.

The tensor electric polarizability of the deuteron significantly influences the buildup of the vertical polarization in the above experiment. The spin interactions depending on the electric dipole moment, the tensor electric polarizability, and main systematical errors caused by field misalignments have very different symmetries. For the considered experimental conditions, the sensitivity to the deuteron EDM of $1\times10^{-29} e\cdot$cm corresponds to measuring the both of tensor polarizabilities with an accuracy of $\delta\alpha_T\approx\delta\beta_T\approx5\times10^{-42}$ cm$^3$. This conservative estimate can be improved by excluding the systematical error caused by the field instability which is negligible for the measurement of the tensor polarizabilities.

If the spin is kept longitudinal for most of the duration of the storage time, the radial E-field acts on the proton electric dipole moment and can cause a measureable vertical spin precession. Studies on spin coherence time, on the polarimeter system, and the electric field show that we can reach the experimental goals.

The resulting harmonic spectrum exhibits a primary plateau due to the coupling of the valence band to the first conduction band, with a cutoff energy that scales linearly with field strength and laser wavelength. We also find a weaker second plateau due to coupling to higher-lying conduction bands, with a cutoff that is also approximately linear in the field strength. To facilitate the analysis of the time-frequency characteristics of the emitted harmonics, we also solve the TDSE in a time-dependent basis set, the Houston states [Phys. Rev.

Here we show that by growing monolayers (ML) of insulators on single-crystal metal surfaces, one can tune the harmonic spectrum by just varying the thickness of the ultrathin layer, not the laser properties. This is shown from numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for $n$ML NaCl/Cu(111) systems ($n=1-50$) based on realistic potentials available in the literature. Remarkably, the harmonic cutoff increases linearly with $n$ and as much as an order of magnitude when going from $n$ $=$ 1 to 30, while keeping the laser intensity low and the wavelength in the near-infrared range. Furthermore, the degree of control that can be achieved in this way is much higher than by varying the laser intensity. The origin of this behavior is the reduction of electronic ""friction"" when moving from the essentially discrete energy spectrum associated with a few-ML system to the continuous energy spectrum (bands) inherent to an extended periodic system.",Tuning High-Harmonic Generation by Controlled Deposition of Ultrathin   Ionic Layers on Metal Surfaces

The turn on/off times are in (or shorter than) the scale of $1/V_L$, so they are faster for the larger bias $V_L$. In addition, the responses for the upwards and downwards bias are asymmetric at large $V_L$. The turn-on time is larger than the turn-off time but the relaxation time \cite{note1} depends only on the coupling strength $\Gamma$ and it is much smaller than the turn-on/off times for the large bias $V_L$.",Response time of a normal-superconductor hybrid system under the   step-like pulse bias

Varying the energy and width of the resonant level on the dot, we first investigate a cross-over from a quantum dot regime to a quantum point contact regime when there is zero coupling to the normal probe. We then study the effect on the supercurrent of the normal probe which is attached to the dot. This normal probe is understood to lead to dephasing, or alternatively to induce reverse proximity effect. We describe the full crossover from zero dephasing to the incoherent case.

We show that the illumination-borne heating induces a local asymmetric demixing of the binary mixture generating a spatial chemical concentration gradient, which is responsible for the particle's self-diffusiophoretic motion. We study this effect as a function of the functionalization of the gold cap, the particle size and the illumination intensity: the functionalization determines what component of the binary mixture is preferentially adsorbed at the cap and the swimming direction (towards or away from the cap); the particle size determines the rotational diffusion and, therefore, the random reorientation of the particle; and the intensity tunes the strength of the heating and, therefore, of the motion.

These morphologies cannot be influenced only by the current, by chemical, material and other etching conditions, but also by an open-loop control, triggering the time scale given by the oxide dissolution time.

Here, we propose two-dimensional (2D) spin models unaffected by this result. Specifically, we introduce repulsive long-range interactions in the toric code and establish a memory lifetime polynomially increasing with the system size.

In this paper we model a new gradient creation mechanism - the ac Stark effect - to provide an improvement in the flexibility of gradient creation and field switching times. We propose this scheme in concert with a move to cold atoms (~1 mK). These temperatures would increase the storage times possible, and the small ensemble volumes would enable large ac Stark shifts with reasonable laser power.

Typical cases of such a phase transition are e.g. quantum Hall effect, superconductivity and superfluidity. Assuming the mechanical stability of this system the effects induced by the conformal degrees of freedom on the phase boundary will be analyzed. We will see that the inclusion of conformal degrees of freedom is not always consistent with the staticity of the phase boundary. Indeed also in the case of mechanical equilibrium there may be the tendency of one phase to swallow the other. Such a shift of the phase boundary would not imply any compression or decompression of the core. By solving the Israel junction conditions for the conformal matter, we have found the range of physical parameters which can guarantee a stable equilibrium of the phase boundary of the neutron star. The relevant parameters turn out to be not only the density difference but also the difference of the slope of the density profiles of the two phases. The values of the parameters which guarantee the stability turn out to be in a phenomenologically reasonable range.

Recent analyses of pulsar glitch data suggest that glitches result from scale-invariant avalanches \citep{Melatos07a}, which are consistent with a self-organized critical system (SOCS). A cellular automaton provides a computationally efficient means of modelling the collective behaviour of up to $10^{16}$ vortices in the pulsar interior, whilst ensuring that the dominant aspects of the microphysics are not lost. The automaton generates avalanche distributions that are qualitatively consistent with a SOCS and with glitch data. The probability density functions of glitch sizes and durations are power laws, and the probability density function of waiting times between successive glitches is Poissonian, consistent with statistically independent events. The output of the model depends on the physical and computational paramters used. The fitted power law exponents for the glitch sizes ($a$) and durations ($b$) decreases as the strength of the vortex pinning increases. Similarly the exponents increase as the fraction of vortices that are pinned decreases.

It is found that electrostriction plays an important role in both solvation structure and free energetics. The angular and radial distributions of cations and anions become more structured and their densities near the solute become enhanced as the solute charge separation grows. Due to the enhancement in structural rigidity induced by electrostriction, the force constant associated with solvent configuration fluctuations relevant to charge shift and transfer processes is also found to increase. The effective polarity and reorganization free energies of these ionic liquids are analyzed and compared with those of highly polar acetonitrile. Their screening behavior of electric charges is also investigated.",A molecular dynamics computer simulation study of room-temperature ionic   liquids. I.

459,2,0703027v1,"The radiation- and photo- chemistry of room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) composed of ammonium, phosphonium, pyrrolidinium, and imidazolium cations and bis(triflyl)amide, dicyanamide, and bis(oxalato)borate anions, have been studied using low-temperature Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). Several classes of radicals have been identified and related to reactions of the primary radiolytically generated electrons and holes. Large yields of terminal and penultimate C-centered radicals are observed in the aliphatic chains of the phosphonium, ammonium and pyrrolidinium cations, but not for imidazolium cation. This pattern can be accounted for by efficient deprotonation of a hole trapped on the cation (the radical dication) that competes with rapid charge transfer to a nearby anion. The latter leads to the formation of stable N- or O-centered radicals. The electrons either react with the protic impurity (for nonaromatic cations) yielding H atoms or the aromatic moiety (for imidazolium cations). Excitation of bis(triflyl)amide anion is shown to yield trifluoromethyl radical; the yield of this radical in radiolysis, though, is low (< 10% of the alkyl radical yield). In terms of their radiation chemistry, neat ILs appear to be intermediate between organic liquids and ionic solids. Addition of 10-40 wt% of trialkylphoshate (a common extraction agent for nuclear cycle separations) has relatively little effect on the fragmentation of the ILs. Radiation induced dealkylation of the phosphate is prominent, but the yield of the alkyl radical fragments derived from the phosphates is < 4% of the yield of the radical fragments drived from the solvent. We discuss the implication of these results for the radiation stability of nuclear cycle extraction systems based upon the IL diluents.",EPR Study of Radicals in Irradiated Ionic Liquids and Implications for   the Radiation Stability of Ionic Liquid-Based Extraction Systems

We observe that the ``solvophobic solvation'' of small apolar particles in ILs is governed by compensating entropic and enthalpic contributions, very much like the hydrophobic hydration of small apolar particles in liquid water. In addition, our simulations clearly indicate that the solvent mediated interaction of apolar particles dissolved in ILs is similarly driven by compensating enthalpic/entropic contributions, making the ``solvophobic interaction'' thermodynamically analogous to the hydrophobic interaction.",The Solvophobic Solvation and Interaction of Small Apolar Particles in   Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids is Characterized by   Enthalpy-/Entropy-Compensation

The dynamically heterogeneous behavior of the model resembles that of fragile supercooled liquids. At or close to room temperature, the model ionic liquid exhibits slow dynamics, characterized by nonexponential structural relaxation and subdiffusive behavior. The structural relaxation time, closely related to the viscosity, shows a super-Arrhenius behavior. Local excitations, defined as displacement of an ion exceeding a threshold distance, are found to be mainly responsible for structural relaxation in the alternating structure of cations and anions. As the temperature is lowered, excitations become progressively more correlated. This results in the decoupling of exchange and persistence times, reflecting a violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation.","Fragility, Stokes-Einstein violation, and correlated local excitations   in a coarse-grained model of an ionic liquid"

461,1,0502111v1,"Electrical transport measurements were made on single-crystal Sn nanowires to understand the intrinsic dissipation mechanisms of a one-dimensional superconductor. While the resistance of wires of diameter larger than 70 nm drops precipitately to zero at Tc near 3.7 K, a residual resistive tail extending down to low temperature is found for wires with diameters of 20 and 40 nm. As a function of temperature, the logarithm of the residual resistance appears as two linear sections, one within a few tenths of a degree below Tc and the other extending down to at least 0.47 K, the minimum temperature of the measurements. The residual resistance is found to be ohmic at all temperatures below Tc of Sn. These findings are suggestive of a thermally activated phase slip process near Tc and quantum fluctuation-induced phase slip process in the low temperature regime. When the excitation current exceeds a critical value, the voltage-current (V-I) curves show a series of discrete steps in approaching the normal state. These steps cannot be fully understood with the classical Skocpol-Beasley-Tinkham phase slip center model (PSC), but can be qualitatively accounted for partly by the PSC model modified by Michotte et al.",Dissipation in Quasi One-Dimensional Superconducting Single-Crystal Sn   Nanowires

Specifically, we investigate how the different types of electron orbits, involving one or two centers, affect the interference patterns in the spectra. We also briefly address the influence of the choice of gauge, and of the initial and final electronic bound states on such patterns. For the length-gauge SFA and undressed bound states, there exist additional terms, which can be interpreted as potential energy shifts. If, on the one hand, such shifts alter the potential barriers through which the electron initially tunnels, and may lead to a questionable physical interpretation of the features encountered, on the other hand they seem to be necessary in order to reproduce the overall maxima and minima in the spectra. Indeed, for dressed electronic bound states in the length gauge, or undressed bound states in the velocity gauge, for which such shifts are absent, there is a breakdown of the interference patterns. In order to avoid such a problem, we provide an alternative pathway for the electron to reach the continuum, by means of an additional attosecond-pulse train. A comparison of the purely monochromatic case with the situation for which the attosecond pulses are present suggests that the patterns are due to the interference between the electron orbits which finish at different centers, regardless of whether one or two centers are involved.",High-harmonic generation in diatomic molecules: a quantum-orbit analysis   of the interference patterns

Hence, the main limitation in increasing the level of integration and in reducing the cost of micron-scale waveguide circuits is their mm- to cm-scale minimum bending radius. Fortunately, single-mode rib waveguides with a micron-scale silicon core can be locally transformed into multi-mode strip waveguides that have very high lateral index contrast.

466,1,0605209v3,"An integral quantity is presented that relates the wake of a body in nominally two-dimensional flow to its drag, for Reynolds numbers ranging from 9,000 to 144,000. It is defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy to the vorticity in the fluid boundary and, for the special case of laminar flow, is proportional to the angular momentum in the wake bubble. The new quantity is useful for correlating drag data for circular and rectangular cylinders, wedges, v-gutters, and normal flat plates with and without splitter plates. The correlation indicates that the drag force is proportional to the flow speed and the mass flow rate stored in the boundary of the fluid, where the fluid boundary is defined so as to include the wake bubble. Order-of-magnitude arguments indicate that, absent any quantization of vortex size, this mass flow rate, and hence the drag force, can become unbounded as the vortices contained in the wake becomes finer.",A correlation between drag and an integral property of the wake

This increase levels up to a Reynolds number close to the critical value for the onset of the first instability. The entrainment is observed to be almost extinguished at a distance which is nearly the same for all the steady wakes within the $R$ range here considered, i.e. [20-100], which indicates that supercritical steady wakes have the same entrainment length as the subcritical ones. It is observed that this distance is equal to a number of body lengths that is equal to the value of the critical Reynolds number ($\sim 47$), as indicated by a large compilation of experimental results. {\it A fortiori} of these findings, we propose to interpret the unsteady bifurcation as a process that allows a smooth increase-redistribution of the entrainment along the wake according to the weight of the convection over the diffusion.

We show that slip significantly delays the onset of recirculation and shedding in the wake behind the cylinder. As expected, the drag on the cylinder decreases with slip, with an increased drag sensitivity for large Reynolds numbers. We also show that past the critical shedding Reynolds number, slip decreases the vorticity intensity in the wake, as well as the lift forces on the cylinder, but increases the shedding frequency. We further provide evidence that the shedding transition can be interpreted as a critical accumulation of surface vorticity, similarly to related studies on wake instability of axisymmetric bodies.

We single out the formation mechanism of the hairpin vortices by means of a detailed analysis of the flow patterns in the steady regime. We show that unlike in previous studies of similar structures, the dynamics of the hairpin vortices is entwined with that of the counter-rotating pair of streamwise vortices, which we found to be generated in the bottom part of the near wake (these are usually referred to as base vortices). In particular, once the hairpin structure is released, the base vortices attach to it, forming its legs, so these are streamwise, and not spanwise as previously observed in unconfined wakes or behind cylinders of lower aspect ratios.

467,1,0610637v1,"We describe the non-relativistic time evolution of an ultra-cold degenerate quantum gas (bosons/fermions) falling in Earth's gravity during long times (10 sec) and over large distances (100 m). This models a drop tower experiment that is currently performed by the QUANTUS collaboration at ZARM (Bremen, Germany). Starting from the classical mechanics of the drop capsule and a single particle trapped within, we develop the quantum field theoretical description for this experimental situation in an inertial frame, the corotating frame of the Earth, as well as the comoving frame of the drop capsule. Suitable transformations eliminate non-inertial forces, provided all external potentials (trap, gravity) can be approximated with a second order Taylor expansion around the instantaneous trap center. This is an excellent assumption and the harmonic potential theorem applies. As an application, we study the quantum dynamics of a cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate in the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field approximation. Due to the instantaneous transformation to the rest-frame of the superfluid wave packet, the long-distance drop (100m) can be studied easily on a numerical grid.",Dropping cold quantum gases on Earth over long times and large distances

We show that instead of collapsing such a mixture gets into a dilute liquid-like droplet state stabilized by quantum fluctuations thus providing a direct manifestation of beyond mean-field effects. We study various properties of the droplet and find, in particular, that in a wide range of parameters its excitation spectrum lies entirely above the particle emission threshold. The droplet thus automatically evaporates itself to zero temperature, the property potentially interesting by itself and from the viewpoint of sympathetic cooling of other systems.",Quantum Mechanical Stabilization of a Collapsing Bose-Bose Mixture
467,3,1601.04501v1,"Collapse in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates may be arrested by quantum fluctuations. Due to the anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interactions, the dipole-driven collapse induced by soft excitations is compensated by the repulsive Lee-Huang-Yang contribution resulting from quantum fluctuations of hard excitations, in a similar mechanism as that recently proposed for Bose-Bose mixtures. The arrested collapse results in self-bound filament-like droplets, providing an explanation to recent dysprosium experiments. Arrested instability and droplet formation are novel general features directly linked to the nature of the dipole-dipole interactions, and should hence play an important role in all future experiments with strongly dipolar gases.",Quantum filaments in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates

We investigate, on the other hand, the effects of thermal fluctuations on the occurrence and stability of a droplet state in a Bose-Einstein condensate with strong dipole-dipole interactions. We find that at finite temperature, the droplet phase appears as a narrow peak surrounded by a broader thermal halo. We show that the number of particles inside the droplet decays with increasing temperature.",Quantum dilute droplets of dipolar bosons at finite temperature

Two physically different regimes are identified, corresponding to small droplets of an approximately Gaussian shape and large `puddles' with a broad flat-top plateau. Small droplets collide quasi-elastically, featuring the soliton-like behavior. On the other hand, large colliding droplets may merge or suffer fragmentation, depending on their relative velocity. The frequency of a breathing excited state of droplets, as predicted by the dynamical variational approximation based on the Gaussian ansatz, is found to be in good agreement with numerical results.

468,3,1803.03211v1,"As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called ""PhaseNet"" that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals, and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in probability provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves, and have the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labeled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The dataset we use contains more than seven million waveform samples extracted from over thirty years of earthquake recordings.

468,4,1805.01075v2,"To optimally monitor earthquake-generating processes, seismologists have sought to lower detection sensitivities ever since instrumental seismic networks were started about a century ago. Recently, it has become possible to search continuous waveform archives for replicas of previously recorded events (template matching), which has led to at least an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected earthquakes and greatly sharpened our view of geological structures. Earthquake catalogs produced in this fashion, however, are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no templates are available, such as in previously quiet regions or for very large magnitude events. Here we show that with deep learning we can overcome such biases without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We trained a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) on the vast hand-labeled data archives of the Southern California Seismic Network to detect seismic body wave phases. We show that the ConvNet is extremely sensitive and robust in detecting phases, even when masked by high background noise, and when the ConvNet is applied to new data that is not represented in the training set (in particular, very large magnitude events). This generalized phase detection (GPD) framework will significantly improve earthquake monitoring and catalogs, which form the underlying basis for a wide range of basic and applied seismological research.",Generalized Seismic Phase Detection with Deep Learning

Current earthquake detection methods, such as waveform correlation and template matching, have difficulty detecting anomalous earthquakes that are not similar to other earthquakes. In recent years, machine-learning techniques for earthquake detection have been emerging as a new active research direction. In this paper, we develop a novel earthquake detection method based on dictionary learning. Our detection method first generates rich features via signal processing and statistical methods and further employs feature selection techniques to choose features that carry the most significant information. Based on these selected features, we build a dictionary for classifying earthquake events from non-earthquake events. To evaluate the performance of our dictionary-based detection methods, we test our method on a labquake dataset from Penn State University, which contains 3,357,566 time series data points with a 400 MHz sampling rate. 1,000 earthquake events are manually labeled in total, and the length of these earthquake events varies from 74 to 7151 data points. Through comparison to other detection methods, we show that our feature selection and dictionary learning incorporated earthquake detection method achieves an 80.1% prediction accuracy and outperforms the baseline methods in earthquake detection, including Template Matching (TM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).",Earthquake Detection in 1-D Time Series Data with Feature Selection and   Dictionary Learning

Our measurements reveal that the heating scheme and the details of the contact geometry play the dominant role in determining the final phase composition of the device such that a non-uniform heating scheme promotes partial amorphization/crystallization for a wide range of pulse parameters enabling multiple resistance levels for data storage applications. Furthermore we find that fluctuations in the snap-back voltage and set/reset resistances in repeated switching experiments are related to the details of the current distribution such that a uniform current injection geometry (i.e. circular contact) favors more reproducible switching parameters. This shows that possible geometrical defects in nanoscale phase change memory devices may play an essential role in the performance of the smallest possible devices through modification of the exact current distribution in the active chalcogenide layer. We present a three-dimensional finite element model of the electro-thermal physics to provide insights into the underlying physical mechanisms of the switching dynamics as well as to quantitatively account for the scaling behaviour of the switching currents in both circular and rectangular contact geometries. The calculated temporal evolution of the heat distribution within the pulse duration shows distinct features in rectangular contacts providing evidence for locally hot spots at the sharp corners of the current injection site due to current crowding effects leading to the observed behaviour.",Electrical Switching Dynamics in Circular and Rectangular Ge2Sb2Te5   Nanopillar Phase Change Memory Devices

However, if magnetic field B increases further, R_{xy} decreases to its normal value. It is shown that in the investigated sample n-Si/Si_{0.7}Ge_{0.3}, overshoots exist for almost all \nu. Existence of overshoot in R_{xy} observed in different materials and for different \nu, where splitting of the adjacent Landau bands has different character, hints at the common origin of this effect. Comparison of the experimental curves R_{xy}(\nu) for \nu = 3 and \nu = 5 with and without overshoot showed that this effect exist in the whole interval between plateaus, not only in the region where R_{xy} exceeds the normal plateau value.","Transverse ""resistance overshoot"" in a Si/SiGe two-dimensional electron   gas in the quantum Hall effect regime"

This drift-velocity depends solely on the ratio of the electric and magnetic fields and not on the initial momentum of the electron. The present work describes the quantum-mechanical version of this drift-motion, which differs drastically from the classical result: The drift becomes dependent on the energy and a quantization of the transport occurs. The results bear implications for the theory of the quantum Hall effect: Current theories neglect the electric Hall-field (which is perpendicular to a magnetic field) and thus do not include the quantization due to the crossed-field geometry. I will discuss why it is not possible to eliminate the electric field and how one can explain the quantization in crossed fields in a semiclassical picture.

In the long-lengths regime we find that a weak absorption or a weak gain induce identical statistical corrections in the inverse localization length, but lead to different corrections in the mean reflection coefficient.

Distinctive capability of analog-to-digital conversion enables us to construct a CCD camera body that outputs only digital signals. As the result of the front-end electronics test, it works properly with low input noise of =<30 uV at the pixel rate below 100 kHz. The power consumption is sufficiently low of about 150 mW/chip.

A case study for the Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) at the European XFEL employing the intensity autocorrelation technique was performed using the detector simulation tool HORUS. As optimum results from XPCS experiments are obtained when the pixel size approximates the (small) speckle size, the presented study compares the AGIPD (pixel size of (200 $\upmu$m)$^2$) to a possible apertured version of the detector and to a hypothetical system with (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$ pixel size and investigates the influence of intensity fluctuations and incoherent noise on the quality of the acquired data.   The intuitive conclusion that aperturing is not beneficial as data is 'thrown away' was proven to be correct for low intensities. For intensities larger than approximately 1 photon per (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$ aperturing was found to be beneficial, as charge sharing effects were excluded by it.   It was shown that for the investigated case (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$ pixels produced significantly better results than (200 $\upmu$m)$^2$ pixels when the average intensity exceeded approximately 0.05 photons per (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$.

However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.",On Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Theory and Applications

However, it requires data that satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion. In many fluid flow experiments, such data are impossible to capture. We propose a new approach that combines ideas from DMD and compressed sensing. Given a vector-valued signal, we take measurements randomly in time (at a sub-Nyquist rate) and project the data onto a low-dimensional subspace. We then use compressed sensing to identify the dominant frequencies in the signal and their corresponding modes. We demonstrate this method using two examples, analyzing both an artificially constructed test dataset and particle image velocimetry data collected from the flow past a cylinder. In each case, our method correctly identifies the characteristic frequencies and oscillatory modes dominating the signal, proving the proposed method to be a capable tool for spectral analysis using sub-Nyquist-rate sampling.",Toward compressed DMD: spectral analysis of fluid flows using   sub-Nyquist-rate PIV data

479,4,1507.02338v4,"We develop a framework for dimension reduction, mode decomposition, and nonparametric forecasting of data generated by ergodic dynamical systems. This framework is based on a representation of the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius groups of unitary operators in a smooth orthonormal basis of the L2 space of the dynamical system, acquired from time-ordered data through the diffusion maps algorithm. Using this representation, we compute Koopman eigenfunctions through a regularized advection-diffusion operator, and employ these eigenfunctions in dimension reduction maps with projectible dynamics and high smoothness for the given observation modality. In systems with pure point spectra, we construct a decomposition of the generator of the Koopman group into mutually commuting vector fields that transform naturally under changes of observation modality, which we reconstruct in data space through a representation of the pushforward map in the Koopman eigenfunction basis. We also establish a correspondence between Koopman operators and Laplace-Beltrami operators constructed from data in Takens delay-coordinate space, and use this correspondence to provide an interpretation of diffusion-mapped delay coordinates for this class of systems. Moreover, we take advantage of a special property of the Koopman eigenfunction basis, namely that the basis elements evolve as simple harmonic oscillators, to build nonparametric forecast models for probability densities and observables. In systems with more complex spectral behavior, including mixing systems, we develop a method inspired from time change in dynamical systems to transform the generator to a new operator with potentially improved spectral properties, and use that operator for vector field decomposition and nonparametric forecasting.",Data-driven spectral decomposition and forecasting of ergodic dynamical   systems
479,5,1508.04642v1,"The identification of coherent structures from experimental or numerical data is an essential task when conducting research in fluid dynamics. This typically involves the construction of an empirical mode base that appropriately captures the dominant flow structures. The most prominent candidates are the energy-ranked proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the frequency ranked Fourier decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). However, these methods fail when the relevant coherent structures occur at low energies or at multiple frequencies, which is often the case. To overcome the deficit of these ""rigid"" approaches, we propose a new method termed Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD). It is based on classical POD and it can be applied to spatially and temporally resolved data. The new method involves an additional temporal constraint that enables a clear separation of phenomena that occur at multiple frequencies and energies. SPOD allows for a continuous shifting from the energetically optimal POD to the spectrally pure Fourier decomposition by changing a single parameter. In this article, SPOD is motivated from phenomenological considerations of the POD autocorrelation matrix and justified from dynamical system theory. The new method is further applied to three sets of PIV measurements of flows from very different engineering problems. We consider the flow of a swirl-stabilized combustor, the wake of an airfoil with a Gurney flap, and the flow field of the sweeping jet behind a fluidic oscillator. For these examples, the commonly used methods fail to assign the relevant coherent structures to single modes. The SPOD, however, achieves a proper separation of spatially and temporally coherent structures, which are either hidden in stochastic turbulent fluctuations or spread over a wide frequency range.",Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition

The strain field in the substrate is computed by an exact solution which is efficiently evaluated using the fast Fourier transform. The strain field in the growing film is computed directly. The resulting coupled system is solved iteratively using the conjugate gradient method. Finally we introduce various approximations in the implementation of KMC to improve the computation speed.

Compressed overlayers display a nucleation-like behavior: the energy accompanying the transformation process displays a maximum at some critical number of atoms, which is small for large enough values of the misfit, and then decreases gradually down to the completion of the transformation, non-monotonically due to the atomistics of the process. On the contrary, the energy change in expanded overlayers increases up to close to the completion of the transformation and then abruptly collapses with the disappearance of the monoatomic steps to produce low-energy facets. This kind of transformation takes place only in materials with strong interatomic bonding. Softer materials under tensile stress are expected to grow predominantly with a planar morphology until misfit dislocations are introduced, or to transform into 3D islands by a different mechanism.

The shift arises from the optical coupling of the molecular excited bound state with the scattering states and the bound states of two colliding $2^3S_1$ atoms. We measure the frequency-shifts for several ro-vibrational levels in the $0^+_u$ potential and find a linear dependence on the photoassociation laser intensity.

The simplicity of this system makes it very appropriate for a detailed study. Indeed, the purely long-range character of the excited potential allows one to calculate exact excited molecular wavefunctions and to use asymptotic expansions at large internuclear distances of the ground state wavefunctions appearing in Franck-Condon type integrals. Moreover, the number of collisional channels to be considered is strongly reduced by the absence of hyperfine structure for 4He* and the use of polarized ultracold atoms and polarized light. This allows us to derive semi-analytical expressions for the shifts showing explicitly their linear dependences on the s-wave scattering length a of spin polarized metastable 4He* atoms.

Subsequent radiative decay produces high vibrational levels of the ground state, $X ^1\Sigma_g^+$. The population distribution of these $X$ state vibrational levels is monitored by resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization through the $2 ^1\Sigma_u^+$ state.

The distribution is typically a power law $D(\Delta)\propto\Delta^{-\xi}$. For the systems we study here, a crossover behavior is seen between two power laws, with a small exponent $\xi$ in the vicinity of complete breakdown and a larger exponent $\xi$ for failures away from the breakdown point.

A similar RFBM with two types of fibers belonging to two different Weibull distribution of threshold strength is also studied. The variation of the critical stress of a one dimensional RFBM with the number of fibers is obtained for strictly uniform distribution and local load sharing using an exact method which assumes one-sided load transfer.

The value of $\alpha$ interpolates between the perfectly brittle failure $(\alpha = 0)$ and perfectly plastic behavior $(\alpha=1)$ of fibers. We show that the finite load bearing capacity of broken fibers has a substantial effect on the failure process of the bundle. In the case of global load sharing it is found that for $\alpha \to 1$ the macroscopic response of the bundle becomes perfectly plastic with a yield stress equal to the average fiber strength. On the microlevel, the size distribution of avalanches has a crossover from a power law of exponent $\approx 2.5$ to a faster exponential decay. For localized load sharing, computer simulations revealed a sharp transition at a well defined value $\alpha_c$ from a phase where macroscopic failure occurs due to localization as a consequence of local stress enhancements, to another one where the disordered fiber strength dominates the damage process. Analysing the microstructure of damage, the transition proved to be analogous to percolation. At the critical point $\alpha_c$, the spanning cluster of damage is found to be compact with a fractal boundary. The distribution of bursts of fiber breakings shows a power law behaviour with a universal exponent $\approx 1.5$ equal to the mean field exponent of fiber bundles of critical strength distributions.

The particles perform undulator motion inside the crystals following the periodic shape of the crystallographic planes. Gamma rays passing the crystals parallel to the beam get amplified due to interaction with the particles inside the crystals.

Most of the unmixing algorithms proposed in the literature do not take into account the possible spatial correlations between the pixels. In this work, a Bayesian model is introduced to exploit these correlations. The image to be unmixed is assumed to be partitioned into regions (or classes) where the statistical properties of the abundance coefficients are homogeneous. A Markov random field is then proposed to model the spatial dependency of the pixels within any class. Conditionally upon a given class, each pixel is modeled by using the classical linear mixing model with additive white Gaussian noise. This strategy is investigated the well known linear mixing model. For this model, the posterior distributions of the unknown parameters and hyperparameters allow ones to infer the parameters of interest. These parameters include the abundances for each pixel, the means and variances of the abundances for each class, as well as a classification map indicating the classes of all pixels in the image.

As it is shown that the Klein-Gordon equation is obtained by Wick rotating the cause vector with de Broglie angular frequency, this paper postulates an equation for Quantum Gravity, which relates the Navier-Stokes equations to the Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity.",Governing Dynamics from cause and effect: -A novel formulation for   causality with applications in Quantum Gravity and Economic Theory

491,2,0505349v1,"We study analytically the effect of metrically structured connectivity on the behavior of autoassociative networks. We focus on three simple rate-based model neurons: threshold-linear, binary or smoothly saturating units. For a connectivity which is short range enough the threshold-linear network shows localized retrieval states. The saturating and binary models also exhibit spatially modulated retrieval states if the highest activity level that they can achieve is above the maximum activity of the units in the stored patterns. In the zero quenched noise limit, we derive an analytical formula for the critical value of the connectivity width below which one observes spatially non-uniform retrieval states. Localization reduces storage capacity, but only by a factor of 2~3. The approach that we present here is generic in the sense that there are no specific assumptions on the single unit input-output function nor on the exact connectivity structure.",Localized activity profiles and storage capacity of rate-based   autoassociative networks

The mechanism of the synfire chain has been analyzed by many resarchers. Keeping the synfire chain phenomenon in mind, we investigate a layered associative memory neural network model, in which patterns are embedded in connections between neurons. In this model, we also include uniform noise in connections, which induces common input in the next layer. Such common input in layers generate correlated firings of neurons. We theoretically obtain the evolution of retrieval states in the case of infinite pattern loading.

The obtained results suggest that the seismogenic area generates electrical signals denoting a specific epicentral area. This area coincides with the already seismically activated area. An estimate for the time of occurrence of this EQ is made by the application of the Oscillating Lithospheric Plate Model. The analysis of the seismic potential of the regional area suggests that the remaining stored seismic energy is capable of producing a large earthquake in the same area.

The original form of the generated preseismic field follows closely the theoretical piezoelectric potential form. The later is obtained after integration in time of the original registered potential grad data values. Consequently, the time of occurrence of the imminent earthquake (collapsing of the rock formation) is estimated by the classical laws of rock fracturing based on theoretical Rock Mechanics.

Due to weak attenuation of oxygen and other gaseous atmospheric constituents in this region, we have only considered the effect of ozone in calculation. The results are important to estimate systematic errors in measuring gas concentration introduced by large wavelength separation in UV-DIAL. The total attenuation (km-1) at wavelengths is listed in the form of a table from 200 to 400 nm for several values of visibilities. It is found the aerosol attenuation in UV region varies quite smoothly with wavelength and therefore systematic error caused by aerosol scattering is negligible in remote sensing by UV-DIAL even with large wavelength separation. Moreover, it has been found that only aerosol extinction is dominant in lidar remote sensing in the lower atmosphere in UV region. In large altitude that aerosol concentration is lower; the molecular scattering is important especially for wavelengths larger than 310 nm.",Investigation of particle and molecular extinction effects in remote   sensing by ultraviolet DIAL in the lower atmosphere

493,5,1002.2833v1,This paper presents a method for determination of interference filter parameters such as the effective refraction index and the maximal transmittance wavelength on the basis of image processing of a spectrogram produced by Spectrometer Airglow Temperature Imager instrument by means of data processing. The method employs the radial sections for determination of points from the crests and valleys in the spectrograms. These points are involved in the least square method for determination of the centres and radii of the crests and valleys. The use of the image radial sections allows to determine the maximal number of crests and valleys in the spectrogram. The application of the least square fitting leads to determination of the image centers and radii of the crests and valleys with precision higher than one pixel. The nocturnal course of the filter parameters produced by this method is presented and compared with that of the known ones.

Here we show that in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets sandwiched between a heavy metal and an oxide, the DMI stabilizes chiral domain walls (DWs) whose spin texture enables extremely efficient current-driven motion. We show that spin torque from the spin Hall effect drives DWs in opposite directions in Pt/CoFe/MgO and Ta/CoFe/MgO, which can be explained only if the DWs assume a N\'eel configuration with left-handed chirality. We directly confirm the DW chirality and rigidity by examining current-driven DW dynamics with magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the spin spiral. This work resolves the origin of controversial experimental results and highlights a new path towards interfacial design of spintronic devices.",Current-driven dynamics of chiral ferromagnetic domain walls

Such a DMI effect modifies the domain-wall (DW) energy density and consequently, results in an asymmetric DW expansion driven by an out-of-plane magnetic field under an in-plane magnetic field bias. From an analysis of the asymmetry, the DMI effect is estimated to be strong enough for the DW to remain in the N\'eel-type configuration in contrast to the general expectations of these materials. Our findings emphasize the critical role of the DMI effect on the DW dynamics as the underlying physics of the asymmetries that are often observed in spin-transfer-related phenomena.",Asymmetric Magnetic Domain-Wall Motion by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya   Interaction

For systems with perpendicular anisotropy, the presence of DM interactions has important consequences for current-driven domain-wall motion and underpins possible spintronic applications involving skyrmions. We show theoretically how spin textures driven by the DM interaction allow nonreciprocal channeling of spin waves, leading to measurable features in magnetic wires, dots, and domain walls.

498,5,1504.04411v1,"Structural symmetry breaking in magnetic materials is responsible for a variety of outstanding physical phenomena. Examples range from the existence of multiferroics, to current induced spin orbit torques (SOT) and the formation of topological magnetic structures. In this letter we bring into light a novel effect of the structural inversion asymmetry (SIA): a chiral damping mechanism. This phenomenon is evidenced by measuring the field driven domain wall (DW) motion in perpendicularly magnetized asymmetric Pt/Co/Pt trilayers. The difficulty in evidencing the chiral damping is that the ensuing DW dynamics exhibit identical spatial symmetry to those expected from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Despite this fundamental resemblance, the two scenarios are differentiated by their time reversal properties: while DMI is a conservative effect that can be modeled by an effective field, the chiral damping is purely dissipative and has no influence on the equilibrium magnetic texture. When the DW motion is modulated by an in-plane magnetic field, it reveals the structure of the internal fields experienced by the DWs, allowing to distinguish the physical mechanism. The observation of the chiral damping, not only enriches the spectrum of physical phenomena engendered by the SIA, but since it can coexists with DMI it is essential for conceiving DW and skyrmion devices.",Chiral damping of magnetic domain walls
499,1,0712.0530v1,"The crystal structure of boron is unique among chemical elements, highly complex, and imperfectly known. Experimentalists report the beta-rhombohedral (black) form is stable over all temperatures from absolute zero to melting. However, early calculations found its energy to be greater than the energy of the alpha-rhombohedral (red) form, implying beta cannot be stable at low temperatures. Furthermore, beta exhibits partially occupied sites, seemingly in conflict with the thermodynamic requirement that entropy vanish at low temperature. Using electronic density functional theory methods and an extensive search of the configuration space we find a unique, energy minimizing pattern of occupied and vacant sites that can be stable at low temperatures but that breaks the beta-rhombohedral symmetry. Even lower energies occur within larger unit cells. Alternative configurations lie nearby in energy, allowing the entropy of partial occupancy to stabilize the beta-rhombohedral structure through a phase transition at moderate temperature.",Symmetry-broken crystal structure of elemental boron at low temperature

The electron-deficient bonding in boron explains its remarkable sensitivity to even small concentrations of impurity atoms and allows boron to form peculiar chemical compounds with very different elements. These complications made the study of boron a great challenge, creating also a unique and instructive chapter in the history of science. Strange though it may sound, the discovery of boron in 1808 was ambiguous, with pure boron polymorphs established only starting from the 1950s-1970s, and only in 2007 was the stable phase at ambient conditions determined.

499,5,0911.3192v2,"Boron is an element of fascinating chemical complexity. Controversies have shrouded this element since its discovery was announced in 1808: the new 'element' turned out to be a compound containing less than 60-70 percent of boron, and it was not until 1909 that 99-percent pure boron was obtained. And although we now know of at least 16 polymorphs, the stable phase of boron is not yet experimentally established even at ambient conditions. Boron's complexities arise from frustration: situated between metals and insulators in the periodic table, boron has only three valence electrons, which would favour metallicity, but they are sufficiently localized that insulating states emerge. However, this subtle balance between metallic and insulating states is easily shifted by pressure, temperature and impurities. Here we report the results of high-pressure experiments and ab initio evolutionary crystal structure predictions that explore the structural stability of boron under pressure and, strikingly, reveal a partially ionic high-pressure boron phase. This new phase is stable between 19 and 89 GPa, can be quenched to ambient conditions, and has a hitherto unknown structure (space group Pnnm, 28 atoms in the unit cell) consisting of icosahedral B12 clusters and B2 pairs in a NaCl-type arrangement.

In a two-dimensional model, the step bunches wander heavily with step-up drift and recombination with neighboring bunches occur more frequently than those with step-down drift and the bunching is accelerated.

Scaling laws obtained previously for non-moving bunches are recovered asymptotically, but singularities of the static theory are removed and strong corrections to scaling are found.

If the landing probability is spatially uniform, the current is proved to be proportional to the average (signed) distance traveled by an adatom before incorporation in the growing surface. The phenomenon of slope selection is determined by the vanishing of the asymmetry delta. We apply our results to the case of atoms feeling step edge barriers and downward funnelling, or step edge barriers and steering.

Long-range ordering at x = 0.5 is confirmed to create a far-infrared gap, in addition to the FIP. At high x, the formation of a Spin-Density Wave reported below 22 K dramatically shifts the FIP to higher energy when x is incommensurate with the lattice, indicating an abrupt deepening of the localizing potential.

Its validity is discussed with the help of the Lanczos method applied to small systems. We find generally ambipolar carrier injections in Mott insulators even if the work function of the crystal is quite different from that of the electrodes.

Therefore, we organized our studies under the following aspects: - We investigated the influence of 11 MeV neutrons on the position resolution of ATLAS MDT chambers. At flux densities between 4 and 16 kHz/cm2, almost no influence on the position resolution was found, it degrades by only 10 mum at a detection efficiency of only 4*10-4. - We investigated inert gas mixtures on fastness and linearity of their position-drifttime (r-t) relation.

Statistics of stick-slip events have been determined, which show that the larger the sample the more regular (i.e. ""periodic"") the sick-slip, the faster the strain rate the less periodic the events. One concludes that this stick-slip is generated at the macroscopic level and comes from the macroscopic rhelogical law. However when sample is small, local fluctuations perturb the macroscopic events and trigger them erratically.

Specifically the clay weight and salt molar concentrations have been varied in the ranges Cw=0.004- 0.025, Cs=(1x 10^-3- 5x 10^-3) M respectively. As in the case of free salt water samples (Cs= 1x 10^-4 M) an aging dynamics towards two different arrested phases is found in the whole examined Cw and Cs range. Moreover a transition between these two different regimes is found for each investigated salt concentration.

506,3,0607602v1,"The aging dynamics after shear rejuvenation in a glassy, charged clay suspension have been investigated through dynamic light scattering (DLS). Two different aging regimes are observed: one is attained if the sample is rejuvenated before its gelation and one after the rejuvenation of the gelled sample. In the first regime, the application of shear fully rejuvenates the sample, as the system dynamics soon after shear cessation follow the same aging evolution characteristic of normal aging. In the second regime, aging proceeds very fast after shear rejuvenation, and classical DLS cannot be used. An original protocol to measure an ensemble averaged intensity correlation function is proposed and its consistency with classical DLS is verified. The fast aging dynamics of rejuvenated gelled samples exhibit a power law dependence of the slow relaxation time on the waiting time.",Aging after shear rejuvenation in a soft glassy colloidal suspension:   evidence for two different regimes

The time spent under convection is found to depend strongly on sample concentration, decreasing exponentially with mass fraction of colloidal particles. Moreover, at fixed concentration, it also depends slightly on the pattern selected by the Rayleigh B\'{e}nard instability: more rolls maintain the convection state longer.

507,1,0704.3792v1,"We examine Gaussian-basis Monte Carlo method (GBMC) introduced by Corney and Drummond. This method is based on an expansion of the density-matrix operator rho by means of the coherent Gaussian-type operator basis Lambda and does not suffer from the minus sign problem. The original method, however, often fails in reproducing the true ground state and causes systematic errors of calculated physical quantities because the samples are often trapped in some metastable or symmetry broken states. To overcome this difficulty, we combine the quantum-number projection scheme proposed by Assaad, Werner, Corboz, Gull and Troyer in conjunction with the importance sampling of the original GBMC method. This improvement allows us to carry out the importance sampling in the quantum-number-projected phase-space. Some comparisons with the previous quantum-number projection scheme indicate that, in our method, the convergence with the ground state is accelerated, which makes it possible to extend the applicability and widen the range of tractable parameters in the GBMC method. The present scheme offers an efficient practical way of computation for strongly correlated electron systems beyond the range of system sizes, interaction strengths and lattice structures tractable by other computational methods such as the quantum Monte Carlo method.",Gaussian-Basis Monte Carlo Method for Numerical Study on Ground States   of Itinerant and Strongly Correlated Electron Systems

Replacing the exact solution of the problem with a statistical estimate requires a measure of the random error in the estimate for it to be useful. Such a measure of confidence is usually provided by assuming the Central Limit Theorem to hold true. In what follows it is demonstrated that, for the most popular implementation of the Variational Monte Carlo method, the Central Limit Theorem has limited validity, or is invalid and must be replaced by a Generalised Central Limit Theorem. Estimates of the total energy and the variance of the local energy are examined in detail, and shown to exhibit uncontrolled statistical errors through an explicit derivation of the distribution of the random error.

At best the Central Limit theorem is valid in its weakest form, and at worst it is invalid and replaced by an alternative Generalised Central Limit theorem and non-Normal random error. In both cases the random error is not controlled. Here we consider a new `residual sampling strategy' that reintroduces the Central Limit Theorem in its strongest form, and provides full control of the random error in estimates.

The goal is to develop an electron gun delivering beam emittance lower than current state of the art. Such a gun should reduce the cost and size of an X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL). In this paper we present two concepts of field emitter cathodes which could potentially produce low emittance beam. The first challenging parameter for such cathode is to emit peak current as high as 5 A. This is the minimum current requirement for the XFEL concept from Paul Scherrer Institut.1 Maximum current of 0.12 A and 0.58 A have been reached respectively with field emitter arrays (FEA) and single needle cathodes.

The configuration with positioning the RF deflectors between the QBA cells in each super-period as an optimum arrangement gives rise to better quality electron bunches and radiated photon pulses. The FWHM of the radiated photon pulses of about 540 fs with an acceptable intensity is attained by optimizing the compression optical elements of the TPS photon beam line. Furthermore, the effects of the electron bunch length are studied by alternatively employing an accelerating RF cavity operating with 1.1 MV and 3.0 MV, respectively.

Based on these ingredients, we propose a simple model to account for the dependence of the height loss on the initial height and volume fraction. As a result of our analysis, we show that the static friction coefficient between the gel and the container walls strongly depends on volume fraction: the higher the volume fraction, the weaker the solid friction.

This is what we can term dynamical typicality. The theoretical analysis is substantiated by numerical simulations of the response of a spin system to a sudden quench of the external magnetic field.

Increasing the coupling between the two modes increases the longer mode length and decreases the shorter mode length. The applied thermal gradient along $x$ leads to a thermal gradient along $z$ that varies as $\sinh{(x/\lambda)}$, which can in turn produce fluxes of the carriers of up- and down- spins along $z$, and gradients of their associated \textit{magnetoelectrochemical potentials} $\bar{\mu}_{\uparrow,\downarrow}$, which vary as $\sinh{(x/\lambda)}$. By the inverse spin Hall effect, this spin current along $z$ can produce a transverse (along $y$) voltage difference $\Delta V_y$, which also varies as $\sinh{(x/\lambda)}$.",Thermal Equilibration and Thermally-Induced Spin Currents in a Thin-Film   Ferromagnet on a Substrate
514,4,1204.5811v2,"We microscopically analyze thermal spin pumping mediated by magnons, at the interface between a ferromagnetic insulator and a non-magnetic metal, in the semiclassical regime. The generation of a spin current is discussed by calculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin conservation law for conduction electrons and operates the coherent magnon state. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between conduction electrons and magnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent non-magnetic metal. The pumped spin current is proportional to the temperature difference. When the effective temperature of magnons is lower than that of conduction electrons, localized spins lose spin angular momentum by emitting magnons and conduction electrons flip from down to up by absorbing all the emitted momentum, and vice versa. Magnons at the zero mode cannot contribute to thermal spin pumping because they are eliminated by the spin-flip condition. Consequently thermal spin pumping does not cost any kinds of applied magnetic fields. We have discussed the distinction from the theory proposed by Xiao et al. [Phys. Rev. B, 81 (2010) 214418], Adachi et al. [Phys. Rev. B, 83 (2011) 094410], and Bender et al. [arXiv:1111.2382].",Thermal spin pumping mediated by magnon in the semiclassical regime

Both Ni and Rh atoms are capable to absorb up to three hydrogen molecules chemically and the metal atom to BN sheet distance increases with the increase in the number of hydrogen molecules.

517,5,1410.3034v1,"Electrolyte gating is a powerful technique for accumulating large carrier densities in surface two-dimensional electron systems (2DES). Yet this approach suffers from significant sources of disorder: electrochemical reactions can damage or alter the surface of interest, and the ions of the electrolyte and various dissolved contaminants sit Angstroms from the 2DES. Accordingly, electrolyte gating is well-suited to studies of superconductivity and other phenomena robust to disorder, but of limited use when reactions or disorder must be avoided. Here we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by protecting the sample with a chemically inert, atomically smooth sheet of hexagonal boron nitride (BN). We illustrate our technique with electrolyte-gated strontium titanate, whose mobility improves more than tenfold when protected with BN. We find this improvement even for our thinnest BN, of measured thickness 6 A, with which we can accumulate electron densities nearing 10^14 cm^-2.

Both of these change, and it is impossible to separate them without more information. We have devised a new three terminal device that provides two resistance measurements that are sufficient to extract both the junction conductance and the two dimensional sheet resistance under the superconducting contact. We have compared junctions between Nb and InAs and Nb and 30% InGaAs all grown before being removed from the ultra high vacuum molecular beam epitaxy growth system. The most transparent junctions are to InAs, where the transmission coefficient per Landauer mode is greater than 0.6. Contacts made with ex-situ deposition are substantially more opaque.

To infer the velocity image of the medium from the measurements of first arrivals is a typical example of ill-posed problem. In the framework of Tikhonov regularization theory, in order to replace an ill-posed problem by a well-posed one and to get a unique and stable solution, a stabilizing functional (stabilizer) has to be introduced. The stabilizer selects the desired solution from a class of solutions with a specific physical and/or geometrical property; e.g., the existence of sharp boundaries separating media with different petrophysical parameters. Usually stabilizers based on maximum smoothness criteria are used during the inversion process; in these cases the solutions provide smooth images which, in many situations, do not describe the examined objects properly. Recently a new algorithm of direct minimization of the Tikhonov parametric functional with minimum support stabilizer has been introduced; it produces clear and focused images of targets with sharp boundaries. In this research we apply this new technique to real radar tomographic data and we compare the obtained result with the solution generated by the more traditional minimum norm stabilizer.",Focusing inversion technique applied to radar tomographic data
523,2,0808.3472v3,"The effects of several nonlinear regularization techniques are discussed in the framework of 3D seismic tomography. Traditional, linear, $\ell_2$ penalties are compared to so-called sparsity promoting $\ell_1$ and $\ell_0$ penalties, and a total variation penalty. Which of these algorithms is judged optimal depends on the specific requirements of the scientific experiment. If the correct reproduction of model amplitudes is important, classical damping towards a smooth model using an $\ell_2$ norm works almost as well as minimizing the total variation but is much more efficient. If gradients (edges of anomalies) should be resolved with a minimum of distortion, we prefer $\ell_1$ damping of Daubechies-4 wavelet coefficients. It has the additional advantage of yielding a noiseless reconstruction, contrary to simple $\ell_2$ minimization (`Tikhonov regularization') which should be avoided. In some of our examples, the $\ell_0$ method produced notable artifacts. In addition we show how nonlinear $\ell_1$ methods for finding sparse models can be competitive in speed with the widely used $\ell_2$ methods, certainly under noisy conditions, so that there is no need to shun $\ell_1$ penalizations.",Nonlinear regularization techniques for seismic tomography
523,3,0905.0239v1,"Seismic waves are the most sensitive probe of the Earth's interior we have. With the dense data sets available in exploration, images of subsurface structures can be obtained through processes such as migration. Unfortunately, relating these surface recordings to actual Earth properties is non-trivial. Tomographic techniques use only a small amount of the information contained in the full seismogram and result in relatively low resolution images. Other methods use a larger amount of the seismogram but are based on either linearization of the problem, an expensive statistical search over a limited range of models, or both. We present the development of a new approach to full waveform inversion, i.e., inversion which uses the complete seismogram. This new method, which falls under the general category of inverse scattering, is based on a highly non-linear Fredholm integral equation relating the Earth structure to itself and to the recorded seismograms. An iterative solution to this equation is proposed. The resulting algorithm is numerically intensive but is deterministic, i.e., random searches of model space are not required and no misfit function is needed. Impressive numerical results in 1D are shown for several test cases.",Direct Waveform Inversion by Iterative Inverse Propagation

The coefficients in this expansion are found via least-squares fitting from a certain number of applications of the normal operator on adequate randomized trial functions built in curvelet space. It is found that the number of parameters that can be fitted increases with the amount of information present in the trial functions, with high probability. Once an approximate inverse Hessian is available, application to an image of the model can be done in very low complexity.

525,4,1211.0781v1,"In this work, transverse shear warping functions for an equivalent single layer plate model are formulated from a variational approach. The part of the strain energy which involves the shear phenomenon is expressed in function of the warping functions and their derivatives. The variational calculus leads to a differential system of equations which warping functions must verify. Solving this system requires the choice of values for the (global) shear strains and their derivatives. A particular choice, which is justified for cross-ply laminates, leads to excellent results. For single layer isotropic and orthotropic plates, an analytical expression of the warping functions is given. They involve hyperbolic trigonometric functions. They differ from the z - 4/3z3 Reddy's formula which has been found to be a limit of present warping functions for isotropic and moderately thick plates. When the h/L and/or the G13/E1 ratios significantly differ from those of isotropic and moderately thick plates, a difference between present warping functions and Reddy's formula can be observed, even for the isotropic single layer plate. Finite element simulations agree perfectly with the present warping functions in these cases. For multilayer cross-ply configurations, the warping functions are determined using a semi-analytical procedure. They have been compared to results of 3D finite element simulations. They are in excellent agreement. For angle-ply laminates, the above process gives warping functions that seem to have relevant shapes, even if the choice for global shear values cannot be justified in this case.

Atomic force microscopy analysis show that these crystals have improved surface roughness (root mean square (rms) value of only ~ 0.1 nm) compared to conventional SiO2 substrate.

The photothermal and photo-reorientation mechanisms, each with its own distinct response time, are proposed to explain the observed time dependence. The measured degree of bending is consistent with a model that we have proposed which includes coupling between photoisomerization and heating.

At least in principle, biaxial smectic elastomers could also be produced via cooling from the smectic-$A$ to a biaxial smectic phase.

We found that these line ratios are sensitive to electron density $n_e$, and the ratio $R_1$ is insensitive to electron temperature $T_e$. Recent work has shown that accurate atomic data, such as electron impact excitation rates, is very important for reliable determination of the electron density of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Present work indicates that the maximum discrepancy of line ratios introduced from different atomic data calculated with distorted wave and R-matrix approximations, is up to 18% in the range of $n_e=10^{9-13}$cm$^{-3}$.

Our result is in agreement with that diagnosed by Chen et al using triplet of N VI. A relative higher diagnosed electron density from $R_2$ is due to its weak sensitivity to electron temperature.

To demonstrate the general applicability of the approach, we provide four examples: (1) the diffusion equation with both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, (2) the diffusion equation with surface diffusion, (3) the mechanical equilibrium equation, and (4) the equation for phase transformation with additional boundaries. The solutions for a few of these cases are validated against corresponding analytical and semi-analytical solutions. The potential of the approach is demonstrated with five applications: surface-reaction diffusion kinetics with a complex geometry, Kirkendall-effect-induced deformation, thermal stress in a complex geometry, phase transformations affected by substrate surfaces, and a self-propelling droplet.",Smoothed Boundary Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations with   General Boundary Conditions on Complex Boundaries

The primary attention is given to the slow dissolution dynamics. The Cahn-Hilliard approach is used to model the behaviour of evolving and diffusing interfaces. An important peculiarity of the full Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations is the use of the full continuity equation required even for a binary mixture of incompressible liquids, firstly, due to dependence of mixture density on concentration and, secondly, due to strong concentration gradients at liquids' interfaces. Using the multiple-scale method we separate the physical processes occurring on different time scales and, ultimately, provide a strict derivation of the Boussinesq approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. This approximation forms a universal theoretical model that can be further employed for a thermo/hydro-dynamic analysis of the multiphase systems with strongly evolving and diffusing interfacial boundaries, i.e. for the processes involving dissolution/nucleation, evaporation/condensation, solidification/melting, polymerisation, etc.",Boussinesq approximation of the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations

Furthermore, employing a two- and three-pulse electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) we separate the quadrupole and hyperfine interactions with the surrounding nuclei. Finally, by applying a method to decouple the spin state from its inhomogeneous nuclear environment - a ""hole-burning"" - the spectral optically detected magnetic resonance linewidth is significantly reduced to several tens of kHz, thus extending the spin coherence time by a factor of three.

We address a longstanding theoretical issue, namely whether singlet fission proceeds via two sequential electron transfer steps mediated by a charge-transfer state or via a direct two-electron transfer process. We find evidence for a superexchange mediated mechanism, whereby the fission process proceeds through virtual charge-transfer states which may be very high in energy. In particular, this mechanism predicts efficient singlet fission on the sub-picosecond timescale, in reasonable agreement with experiment. We investigate the role played by molecular vibrations in mediating relaxation and decoherence, finding that different physically reasonable forms for the bath relaxation function give similar results.

We have also studied the donor/acceptor (D/A) substituted tetracenes with D and A groups placed symmetrically about the long axis of the molecule. In these cases, by exploiting a new symmetry, which is a combination of $C_2$ symmetry and electron-hole symmetry, we are able to obtain their low-lying states.

In all the systems we have studied, the excited singlet state, $S_1$ is at more than twice the energy of the lowest triplet state and the second triplet is very close to $S_1$ state. Thus donor-acceptor substituted tetracene could be a good candidate in photo-voltaic device application as it satisfies energy criteria for singlet fission.

In the case of DRL trained with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than training the Artificial Neural Network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution. Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches. The first one, which is well documented in the literature, is to parallelize the numerical simulation itself. The second one is to adapt the DRL algorithm for parallelization. Here, a simple strategy is to use several independent simulations running in parallel to collect experiences faster. In the present work, we discuss this solution for parallelization. We illustrate that perfect speedups can be obtained up to the batch size of the DRL agent, and slightly suboptimal scaling still takes place for an even larger number of simulations.

Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics incorporates elements of and unifies the two seemingly divergent dominant theories of continential displacement, plate tectonics theory and Earth expansion theory. Whole-Earth decompression is the consequence of Earth formation from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet with subsequent loss of gases and ices and concomitant rebounding. The initial whole-Earth decompression is expected to result in a global system of major primary decompression cracks appearing in the rigid crust which persist as the basalt feeders for the global, mid-oceanic ridge system. As the Earth subsequently decompresses, the area of the Earth's surface increases by the formation of secondary decompression cracks, often located near the continental margins, presently identified as oceanic trenches. These secondary decompression cracks are subsequently in-filled with basalt, extruded from the mid-oceanic ridges, which traverses the ocean floor by gravitational creep, ultimately plunging into secondary decompression cracks, emulating subduction. Much of the evidence presented in support of plate tectonics supports Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics, but without necessitating mantle convection/circulation or basalt re-cycling.

537,4,0810.3095v2,"We report an experimental study of the intermittent dynamics of a gas flowing through a column of a non-Newtonian fluid. In a given range of the imposed constant flow rate, the system spontaneously alternates between two regimes: bubbles emitted at the bottom either rise independently one from the other or merge to create a winding flue which then connects the bottom air entrance to the free surface. The observations are reminiscent of the spontaneous changes in the degassing regime observed on volcanoes and suggest that, in the nature, such a phenomenon is likely to be governed by the non-Newtonian properties of the magma. We focus on the statistical distribution of the lifespans of the bubbling and flue regimes in the intermittent steady state. The bubbling regime exhibits a characteristic time whereas, interestingly, the flue lifespan displays a decaying power-law distribution. The associated exponent, which is significantly smaller than the value 1.5 often reported experimentally and predicted in some standard intermittency scenarios, depends on the fluid properties and can be interpreted as the ratio of two characteristic times of the system.",Intermittent outgassing through a non-Newtonian fluid
537,5,1002.1587v2,A simple magma accretion model of the oceanic lithosphere is proposed and its implications for understanding the thermal field of oceanic lithosphere examined. The new model (designated VBA) assumes existence of lateral variations in magma accretion rates and temperatures at the boundary zone between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere. Heat flow and bathymetry variations calculated on the basis of the VBA model provide vastly improved fits to respective observational datasets. The improved fits have been achieved for the entire age range and without the need to invoke the ad-hoc hypothesis of large-scale hydrothermal circulation in stable ocean crust.

538,1,0812.4252v2,"Using the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method, we numerically study the spin dynamics and transport in one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems at zero temperature. Instead of computing transport coefficients from linear response theory, we study the real-time evolution of the magnetization starting from spatially inhomogeneous initial states. In particular, we are able to analyze systems far away from equilibrium with this set-up. By computing the time-dependence of the variance of the magnetization, we can distinguish diffusive from ballistic regimes, depending on model parameters. For the example of the anisotropic spin-1/2 chain and at half filling, we find the expected ballistic behavior in the easy-plane phase, while in the massive regime the dynamics of the magnetization is diffusive. Our approach allows us to tune the deviation of the initial state from the ground state and the qualitative behavior of the dynamics turns out to be valid even for highly perturbed initial states in the case of easy-plane exchange anisotropies. We further cover two examples of nonintegrable models, the frustrated chain and the two-leg spin ladder, and we encounter diffusive transport in all massive phases. In the former system, our results indicate ballistic behavior in the critical phase. We discuss our findings in view of experiments on quasi-one dimensional quantum magnets and we propose that the study of the time-dependence of the spatial variance of particle densities could be instrumental in the characterization of the expansion of ultracold atoms in optical lattices as well.",A real-time study of diffusive and ballistic transport in spin-1/2   chains using the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group   method

We concretely consider spin transport in the anisotropic Heisenberg chain, the pure Heisenberg chain within an alternating field, and energy transport in an Ising chain which is exposed to a tilted field. Our approach is essentially based on a connection between the evolution of the variance of an inhomogeneous non-equilibrium density and the current auto-correlation function at finite times. Although this relationship is not restricted to the case of diffusive transport, it allows to extract a quantitative value for the diffusion constant in that case. By means of numerically exact diagonalization we indeed observe diffusive behavior in the considered spin chains for a range of model parameters and confirm the diffusion coefficients which were obtained for these systems from non-equilibrium bath scenarios.",Density dynamics in translationally invariant spin-1/2 chains at high   temperatures: a current auto-correlation approach to finite time- and   length-scales
538,5,1006.4511v1,We investigate spin transport in the anisotropic Heisenberg chain in the limit of high temperatures ({\beta} \to 0). We particularly focus on diffusion and the quantitative evaluation of diffusion constants from current autocorrelations as a function of the anisotropy parameter {\Delta} and the spin quantum number s. Our approach is essentially based on an application of the time-convolutionless (TCL) projection operator technique. Within this perturbative approach the projection onto the current yields the decay of autocorrelations to lowest order of {\Delta}. The resulting diffusion constants scale as 1/{\Delta}^2 in the Markovian regime {\Delta}<<1 (s=1/2) and as 1/{\Delta} in the highly non-Markovian regime above {\Delta} \sim 1 (arbitrary s). In the latter regime the dependence on s appears approximately as an overall scaling factor \sqrt{s(s+1)} only. These results are in remarkably good agreement with diffusion constants for {\Delta}>1 which are obtained directly from the exact diagonalization of autocorrelations or have been obtained from non-equilibrium bath scenarios.,Projection operator approach to spin diffusion in the anisotropic   Heisenberg chain at high temperatures

In the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, the magnetic and electronic structures of kagome lattices are further entangled, which can lead to hitherto unknown spin-orbit phenomena. Here we use a combination of vector-magnetic-field capability and scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the spin-orbit nature of the kagome ferromagnet Fe3Sn2 and explore the associated exotic correlated phenomena.

This discrepancy is a result of silicon photonics's requirement for a single-crystalline silicon (c-Si) layer and a thick undercladding for optical guiding that bulk silicon wafers to not provide. While the undercladding problem can be partially addressed by substrate removal techniques, the complexity of co-integrating photonics with state-of-the-art transistors and real estate competition between electronics and photonics remain problematic.

Employing the first-principles density functional theory and modern theory of polarization, we show that the unique ionic-potential anharmonicity can induce spontaneous in-plane electrical polarizations and ferroelectricity in monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides MX (M=Ge, Sn; X=S, Se). Using Monte Carlo simulations with an effective Hamiltonian extracted from the parameterized energy space, we show these materials exhibit a two-dimensional ferroelectric phase transition that is described by fourth-order Landau theory.

BP_5 monolayer is a multiferroic material with coupled ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity. The predicted reversible strain is up to 41.41%, which is the largest among all reported ferroelastic materials. Due to the non-centrosymmetric structure and electronegativity differences between boron and phosphorus atoms, an in-plane spontaneous polarization of 326.0 pC/m occurs in BP_5. Moreover, the recently hunted negative Poisson's ratio property, is also observed in BP_5. As an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.34 eV, BP_5 displays outstanding optical and electronic properties, for instance strongly anisotropic visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility. The rich and extraordinary properties of BP_5 make it a potential nanomaterial for designing electromechanical or optoelectronic devices, such as nonvolatile memory with conveniently readable/writeable capability.

The spin operator of double exchange interaction in crystal between ions with different valence Mn3+ and Mn4+ is the straight generalization of two-spin operator in the known problem of Anderson and Hasegawa molecule. Minimization of the ground state energy with respect to direction angles of magnetic sub-lattices leads to a system of transcendental equations whose solutions give 11 types of magnetic configurations: two ferromagnetic, three collinear antiferromagnetic and six non-collinear.

As a whole the sequence of configurations when x changes from 0 till 1 can be brought in correspondence to those observed on the experiment.

A linear temperature dependence of the unit cell volume was found between T_{N}=38$ K and 100 K, suggesting that a low-energy lattice excitation may be responsible for the lattice expansion in this temperature range. Between T* ~ 65 K and T_{N}, all lattice parameters showed incipient magnetoelastic effects, due to short-range spin correlations. An anisotropic strain along the a-direction was also observed below T*. Below T_{N}, a relatively large contraction of the a-parameter following the square of the average sublattice magnetization of Mn was found, indicating that a second-order spin hamiltonian accounts for the magnetic interactions along this direction.

The data reveal that there is only one transition observed over the entire range of variables explored, which is a combined magnetic and structural transformation between the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phases (Tc~255 K for this composition). The structural part of the transition is associated with an expansion of the hexagonal unit cell in the direction of the a- and b-axes and a contraction of the c-axis as the FM phase is formed, which originates from an increase in the intra-layer metal-metal bond distance. The application of pressure is found to have an adverse effect on the formation of the FM phase since pressure opposes the expansion of the lattice and hence decreases Tc. The application of a magnetic field, on the other hand, has the expected effect of enhancing the FM phase and increasing Tc. We find that the substantial range of temperature/field/pressure coexistence of the PM and FM phases observed is due to compositional variations in the sample. In-situ high temperature diffraction measurements were carried out to explore this issue, and reveal a coexisting liquid phase at high temperatures that is the origin of this variation. We show that this range of coexisting phases can be substantially reduced by appropriate heat treatment to improve the sample homogeneity.","Temperature, magnetic field, and pressure dependence of the crystal and   magnetic structures of the magnetocaloric compound Mn1.1Fe0.9(P0.8Ge0.2)"

We have performed variable-cell {\it ab initio} molecular dynamic simulations at relevant thermodynamic conditions across one of the measured melting curves. The calculated equilibrium volumes and densities are compared with the simulations using an orthorhombic perovskite configuration under the same conditions. For molten MgSiO$_3$, we have determined the diffusion coefficients and shear viscosities at different thermodynamic conditions.

Nevertheless, neutral or negatively buoyant melts from (Mg,Fe)SiO$_3$ perovskite compositions at deep lower mantle conditions are consistent with existing experimental constraints on solid-liquid partition coefficients for Fe. Our simulations indicate that MgSiO$_3$ is liquid at 120 GPa and 4500 K, consistent with the lower range of experimental melting curves for this material.

The solubility of U in liquid Fe is in the range of 0.6 to 800 ppm and increases with temperature (T) and pressure (P). When P = or > 7 GPa and T > Tmelt of the silicate phase (olivine), the U concentration in Fe is 3 to 5 times greater than for run products where T < Tmelt of the silicate phase. Correspondingly, partitioning coefficient DU values can reach 0.031 at 8.5 GPa (using BN sample container) and 0.036 at 14.5 GPa (using graphite sample container). This implies that if a terrestrial-type planetary core with a pure Fe composition formed from a deep magma ocean (T > Tmelt of the silicate phase), then > 2.4 ppb U could have entered the core. Alternatively, if a core with same composition formed by percolation (T < Tmelt of the silicate phase), then based on the experimental results indicating DU increases with increasing P, 1 to 4 ppb U may have entered the core. The concentration of Si in liquid Fe also increases with pressure. The concentration of Ca is < 0.44 wt % for most samples and no relation with U concentration is found, which indicates that U may alloy with Fe directly. If Si concentration in the Fe phase can be used as an indicator of oxygen fugacity, then the increase in Si and U with pressure suggests a pressure dependent decrease in oxygen fugacity. This supports U (and possibly also Si) inclusion in the the core of Earth at the time of core formation. The implications for radioactive heating in the planetary cores are briefly discussed.

Their amount and distribution, and the temperature in the core, are essential for understanding how the core and the mantle interact and for modelling the geodynamo which generates the planetary magnetic field. However, there is a longstanding controversy surrounding the identity and quantity of the light elements. Here, the theory of tricritical phenomena is employed as a precise theoretical framework to study solidification at the high pressures and temperatures where both experimental and numerical methods are complicated to implement and have large uncertainties in their results. Combining the theory with the most reliable iron melting data and the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) seismic data, one obtains the solidification temperature at the inner core boundary (ICB) for both pure iron and for the alloy of iron and light elements in the actual core melt. One also finds a value of about 2.5 mole% for the amount of light matter. In addition, the density of both solid and liquid pure iron at its melting temperature is found. This allows one to obtain the density of the light matter and thus to identify it to be MgSiO3.","Light matter in the core of the Earth: its identity, quantity and   temperature using tricritical phenomena"

Drawing on these results, we explain how clonal fate data may be used to infer the rules of cell division and differentiation underlying the maintenance of adult murine tail-skin. We show that the rates of cell division and differentiation may be evaluated by considering the long-time and short-time clone fate data, and that the data is consistent with cells dividing independently rather than synchronously. Motivated by these findings, we consider a mechanism for cancer onset based closely on the model for normal adult skin.

550,2,0712.0133v1,"This paper presents an interesting experimental example of voter-model statistics in biology. In recent work on mouse tail-skin, where proliferating cells are confined to a two-dimensional layer, we showed that cells proliferate and differentiate according to a simple stochastic model of cell division involving just one type of proliferating cell that may divide both symmetrically and asymmetrically. Curiously, these simple rules provide excellent predictions of the cell population dynamics without having to address their spatial distribution. Yet, if the spatial behaviour of cells is addressed by allowing cells to diffuse at random, one deduces that density fluctuations destroy tissue confluence, implying some hidden degree of spatial regulation in the physical system. To infer the mechanism of spatial regulation, we consider a two-dimensional model of cell fate that preserves the overall population dynamics. By identifying the resulting behaviour with a three-species variation of the ""Voter"" model, we predict that proliferating cells in the basal layer should cluster. Analysis of empirical correlations of cells stained for proliferation activity confirms that the expected clustering behaviour is indeed seen in nature.",Mechanism of murine epidermal maintenance: Cell division and the Voter   Model

Dkk1 is a negative regulator of Wnt signalling. In chicken and mouse embryos there is a gradient of Wnt in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) decreasing from the posterior to the anterior end.

The solution of the Navier--Stokes equations is carried out with a viscous vortex particle method. Configurations of tethered pairs of fish arranged side by side are studied by varying the lateral separation distance and relative phase difference. It is shown that, in mirroring symmetry, the fish in the pair augment each other's thrust even at relatively large separations (up to ten body lengths). At small distances, this augmentation is primarily brought about by a peristaltic pumping in the gap between the fish, whereas at larger distances, the thrust is affected by subtle changes in the vortex shedding at the tail due to interactions with the other fish. In cases without symmetric undulation, one fish always draws more benefit from the interaction than the other. Finally, lateral configurations with three fish are studied with mirroring symmetry between neighboring fish.

In these races, the difference between gold and missing the medal stand altogether can be hundredths of a second per run. As such, reducing aerodynamic drag through proper body positioning is of first order importance. To better study the flow behavior and to improve the performance of the athletes, we constructed a mock section of a bobsled track which was positioned at the exit of an open loop wind tunnel.

Experiments with flapping foils have exhibited maximum propulsive efficiency in the interval 0.25 < St < 0.35 and it has been argued that animals likely evolved to swim in the same narrow interval. Using Lighthill's elongated-body theory to address undulatory propulsion, it is demonstrated here that the optimal Strouhal number increases from 0.15 to 0.8 for animals spanning from the largest cetaceans to the smallest tadpoles. To assess the validity of this model, the swimming kinematics of 53 different species of aquatic animals have been compiled from the literature and it shows that their Strouhal numbers are consistently near the predicted optimum.",Optimal Strouhal number for swimming animals

Recently synthesized two-dimensional transition metal carbides M$_2$C (M=Hf, Nb, Sc, Ta, Ti, V, Zr), known as MXenes, has aroused increasingly attentions in nanoelectronic technology due to their unusual properties. In this paper, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory are carried out to investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of M$_2$C subjected to biaxial symmetric mechanical strains. At the strain-free state, all these MXenes exhibit no spontaneous magnetism except for Ti$_2$C and Zr$_2$C which show a magnetic moment of 1.92 and 1.25 $\mu_B$/unit, respectively. As the tensile strain increases, the magnetic moments of MXenes are greatly enhanced and a transition from nonmagnetism to ferromagnetism is observed for those nonmagnetic MXenes at zero strains. The most distinct transition is found in Hf$_2$C, in which the magnetic moment is elevated to 1.5 $\mu_B$/unit at a strain of 15%. We further show that the magnetic properties of Hf$_2$C are attributed to the band shift mainly composed of Hf(5$d$) states.

As an important parameter to design new electronic devices, we investigate the work functions of bare MXenes and their functionalized ones with F, OH, and O chemical groups using first-principles calculations. From our calculations, it turns out that the OH terminated MXenes attain ultralow work functions between 1.6 and 2.8 eV. Moreover, depending on the type of the transition metal, the F or O functionalization affects increasing or decreasing the work functions. We show that the changes in the work functions upon functionalizations are linearly correlated with the changes in the surface dipole moments. It is shown that the work functions of the F or O terminated MXenes are controlled by two factors: the induced dipole moments by the charge transfers between F/O and the substrate, and the changes in the total surface dipole moments caused by surface relaxation upon the functionalization. However, in the cases of the OH terminated MXenes, in addition to these two factors, the intrinsic dipole moments of the OH groups play an important role in determining the total dipole moments and consequently justify their ultralow work functions.",OH terminated two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides   (MXenes) as ultralow work function materials

This is in contrast to claims of previous work in which we identify a technical mistake. For metallic photonic crystal slabs, we introduce a simple classical model of two coupled Lorentz oscillators, corresponding to the plasmon and waveguide modes. This model describes very well the key experimental features of linear optics, particularly the Fano-like lineshapes. The derived nonlinear-optical THG spectra are shown to depend on the underlying source of the optical nonlinearity. We present corresponding THG experiments with metallic photonic crystal slabs. In contrast to previous work, we spectrally resolve the interferometric THG signal, and we additionally obtain a higher temporal resolution by using 5 fs laser pulses.

The transmission process is driven by a number of physical mechanisms, whose characteristics and relative importance depend on the thickness of the metallic substrate, slit size, and slit separation. In this work we show that a combination of cavity effects and surface plasmon generation gives rise to enhanced second harmonic generation in the regime of extraordinary transmittance of the pump field. We have studied both forward and backward second harmonic generation conversion efficiencies as functions of the geometrical parameters, and how they relate to pump transmission efficiency. The resonance phenomenon is evident in the generated second harmonic signal, as conversion efficiency depends on the duration of incident pump pulse, and hence its bandwidth.

To this effect we first analyze the net hamiltonian, H(N), of N conduction electrons to identify its universal part, H_o(N) (independent of the nature of a specific solid or a specific class of solids), and then study the states of H_o(N) to conclude that superconductivity originates, basically, from an inter-play between the zero- point force (f_o) of conduction electrons in their ground state and the inter-atomic forces (f_a) which decide the lattice structure. This renders a kind of mechanical strain in the lattice which serves as the main source of phonon induced inter-electron attraction responsible for the formation of Cooper type pairs and the onset of superconductivity below certain temperature T_c. We determine the binding energy of such pairs and find a relation for T_c which not only accounts for the highest experimental T_c = 135 K that we know to-day but also indicates that superconductivity may, in principle, occur at room temperature. It is evident that electrical strain in the lattice (i.e., electrical polarization of the lattice constituents produced by the charge of conducting electrons) can have an added contribution to the phonon induced attraction of two electrons. Our theoretical framework not only incorporates BCS model but also provides microscopic basis for the two well known phenomenologies of superconductivity, viz., the two fluid theory and Psi-theory.

For droplets sizes less than $100\,\mu m$ a simple model of motion in a viscous medium predicts that isolated viruses could remain suspended in quiet air for more than a month, while small droplets of $1\,\mu m$ in size can remain suspended for several hours, in agreement with recent experimental results on virus stability in aerosols.

In this paper, we develop a model that tries to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions.

Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the propagation of droplets containing virus assumes immense importance. Here we investigate the evolution of droplets in space and time under varying external conditions of temperature, humidity and wind flow by using laws of statistical and fluid mechanics. The effects of drag, diffusion and the gravity on droplets of different sizes and ejection velocities have been considered during their motion in the air. In still air we found that bigger droplets traverse larger distance but the smaller droplets remain suspended in the air for longer time. So, in still air the horizontal distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is determined by the bigger droplets but the time interval to be maintained is determined by the smaller droplets. We show that in places with wind flow the lighter droplets travel larger distance and remain suspended in the air for longer time. Therefore, we conclude that both temporal and the geometric distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is determined by the smaller droplets under flowing air which makes the use of mask mandatory to prevent the virus. The maintenance of only stationary separation between healthy and infected individuals is not substantiated.

Remarkably, the probability of being in the growing (stopping) state is very close to 1/4 (3/4) in all experiments, even if the rates vary considerably.

In this study, the correlation between the lag time and the maximal rate of protein aggregation is analyzed. It is found that the product of these two quantities depends on a single numerical parameter, the kinetic index of the curve quantifying the time evolution of the fraction of protein aggregated. As this index depends relatively little on the conditions and/or system studied, our finding provides insight into why for many experiments the values of the product of the lag time and the maximal aggregation rate are often equal or quite close to each other.

We focus on the situation where the underlying data have many different statistical components, representing a variety of independent patterns. Considering a single parameter family of models we show how LBP may be used to encode and decode efficiently such information, without solving the NP hard inverse problem yielding the optimal MRF. Contrary to usual practice, we work in the non-convex Bethe free energy minimization framework, and manage to associate a belief propagation fixed point to each component of the underlying probabilistic mixture. The mean field limit is considered and yields an exact connection with the Hopfield model at finite temperature and steady state, when the number of mixture components is proportional to the number of variables.

In the low temperature regime (T<4), we find that the algorithm typically does not converge, yielding diverging values for the couplings. However, we show that by stopping the algorithm at the right time before divergence becomes serious, good reconstruction can be achieved down to T~2. We then show that dense connectivity, loopiness of the connectivity, and high absolute magnetization all have deteriorating effects on the performance of the algorithm.

The magneto-induced deformation and the Young's modulus of MSEs are calculated as functions of the strength of the external magnetic field. We show that the magneto-mechanical behaviour of MSEs is very sensitive to the spatial distribution of the magnetic particles.

559,5,1306.0277v1,"We introduce and investigate a coarse-grained model for quasi one-dimensional ferrogels. In our description the magnetic particles are represented by hard spheres with a magnetic dipole moment in their centers. Harmonic springs connecting these spheres mimic the presence of a cross-linked polymer matrix. A special emphasis is put on the coupling of the dipolar orientations to the elastic deformations of the matrix, where a memory effect of the orientations is included. Although the particles are displaced along one spatial direction only, the system already shows rich behavior: as a function of the magnetic dipole moment, we find a phase transition between ""soft-elastic"" states with finite interparticle separation and finite compressive elastic modulus on the one hand, and ""hardened"" states with touching particles and therefore diverging compressive elastic modulus on the other hand. Corresponding phase diagrams are derived neglecting thermal fluctuations of the magnetic particles. In addition, we consider a situation in which a spatially homogeneous magnetization is initially imprinted into the material. Depending on the strength of the magneto-mechanical coupling between the dipole orientations and the elastic deformations, the system then relaxes to a uniaxially ferromagnetic, an antiferromagnetic, or a spiral state of magnetization to minimize its energy. One purpose of our work is to provide a largely analytically solvable approach that can provide a benchmark to test future descriptions of higher complexity.

The particle interactions are determined by the superparamagnetic behavior of the particles. They can thus be arranged in a crystalline order by application of an external magnetic field. Therefore the motion of the particles through a narrow channel occurs in well-defined lanes. The arrangement of the particles is perturbed by diffusion and the motion induced by gravity. Due to these combined influences a density gradient forms along the direction of motion of the particles. A reconfiguration of the crystal is observed leading to a reduction of the number of lanes. In the course of the lane reduction transition a local melting of the quasi-crystalline phase to a disordered phase and a subsequent crystallization along the motion of the particles is observed.

567,1,0506568v1,"For the Saffman-Taylor instability, the inertia of the fluid may become important for large Reynolds numbers Re. We investigate the effects of inertia on the width of the viscous fingers experimentally. We find that, due to inertia, the finger width can increase with increasing speed, contrary to what happens at small Re. We find that inertial effects need to be considered above a critical Weber number We. In this case it can be shown that the finger width is governed by a balance between viscous forces and inertia. This allows us to define a modified control parameter 1/B', which takes the corrections due to inertia into account; rescaling the experimental data with 1/B', they all collapse onto the universal curve for the classical Saffman-Taylor instability. Subsequently, we try and rationalize our observations. Numerical simulations taking into account a modification of Darcy law to include inertia, are found to only qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings, pointing to the importance of three-dimensional effects.",Inertial effects in the Saffman-Taylor instability

A variety of fingering instabilities are observed, depending on the velocity of the front (the injection rate), and on which fluid is injected into which.

When this viscosity is used to define the control parameter of the instability, the classical finger selection for Newtonian fluids is recovered. However, this picture breaks down when the cell thickness is decreased below approximatively 10 grain sizes. The discrete nature of the grains plays also a determinant role in the the early destabilization of the fingers observed. The grains produce a perturbation at the interface proportional to the grain size and can thus be considered as a ""controlled noise"".

According to the second law of thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist. Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature it is taken for granted that such mechanism is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation.

These are needed because the equations of motion are inherently non-local and include ``diffusive'' or square-gradient terms. Using the diffusive Johnson-Segalman model and a variant of the Rolie-Poly model for entangled micelles or polymer solutions, we study the interplay between different boundary conditions and the intrinsic stress gradient imposed by the flow geometry. We consider prescribed gradient (Neumann) or value (Dirichlet) of the viscoelastic stress tensor at the boundary, as well as mixed boundary conditions in which an anchoring strength competes with the gradient contribution to the stress dynamics. We find that hysteresis during shear rate sweeps is suppressed if the boundary conditions favor the state that is induced by the sweep. For example, if the boundaries favor the high shear rate phase then hysteresis is suppressed at the low shear rate edges of the stress plateau. If the boundaries favor the low shear rate state, then the high shear rate band can lie in the center of the flow cell, leading to a three-band configuration. Sufficiently strong stress gradients due to curved flow geometries, such as that of cylindrical Couette flow, can convert this to a two-band state by forcing the high shear rate phase against the wall of higher stress, and can suppress the hysteresis loop observed during a shear rate sweep.","The interplay between boundary conditions and flow geometries in shear   banding: hysteresis, band configurations, and surface transitions"

574,4,1708.07407v3,"Recently the question of phonon angular momentum has been raised : phonon angular momentum in a magnetic crystal could play an important role in the angular momentum balance in the Einstein-de Haas effect. This proposition is quite natural and understandable, however the idea of phonon spin seems ambiguous in the literature. In 1988 McLellan presented phonon angular momentum states for circular and elliptical polarizations of phonons that represent orbital angular momentum and also pointed out analogy to isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. In view of its fundamental importance we investigate this issue and conclude that phonon spin hypothesis is physically untenable, and the phonon angular momentum has to be interpreted as orbital. The photon-phonon analogy is also misleading.

Until now, the timescales of electron-to-lattice angular momentum transfer remain unclear, since modeling this process on a microscopic level requires addition of an infinite amount of quantum angular momenta.

Focusing on energy storage and batteries, we demonstrate that quantum mechanics can lead to an enhancement in the amount of work deposited per unit time, i.e., the charging power, when $N$ batteries are charged collectively. We first derive analytic upper bounds for the collective \emph{quantum advantage} in charging power for two choices of constraints on the charging Hamiltonian. We then highlight the importance of entanglement by proving that the quantum advantage vanishes when the collective state of the batteries is restricted to be in the separable ball. Finally, we provide an upper bound to the achievable quantum advantage when the interaction order is restricted, i.e., at most $k$ batteries are interacting.

We contrast this collective model (""Dicke QB""), whereby entanglement is genuinely created by the common photonic mode, to the one in which each two-level system is coupled to its own separate cavity mode (""Rabi QB"").

Some of these schemes for `quantum batteries' rely on the use of global many-body interactions that take the batteries through a correlated short cut in state space. Here, we extend the notion of a quantum battery from a collection of a priori isolated systems to a many-body quantum system with intrinsic interactions. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional spin chain with physically realistic two-body interactions. We find that the spin-spin interactions can yield an advantage in charging power over the non-interacting case, and we demonstrate that this advantage can grow super-extensively when the interactions are long ranged. However, we show that, unlike in previous work, this advantage is a mean-field interaction effect that does not involve correlations and that relies on the interactions being intrinsic to the battery.",Spin-chain model of a many-body quantum battery

These experiments have found that, as the temperature is lowered, phase-slippage in the pores changes its character, from synchronous to asynchronous. Inspired by these experiments, we construct a model to address the characteristics of phase-slippage in superflow through nanopore arrays. We focus on the low-temperature regime, in which the current-phase relation for a single pore is linear, and thermal fluctuations may be neglected. Our model incorporates two basic ingredients: (1) each pore has its own random value of critical velocity (due, e.g., to atomic-scale imperfections), and (2) an effective inter-pore coupling, mediated through the bulk superfluid. The inter-pore coupling tends to cause neighbours of a pore that has already phase-slipped also to phase-slip; this process may cascade, creating an avalanche of synchronously slipping phases. As the temperature is lowered, the distribution of critical velocities is expected to effectively broaden, owing to the reduction in the superfluid healing length, leading to a loss of synchronicity in phase-slippage. Furthermore, we find that competition between the strength of the disorder in the critical velocities and the strength of the inter-pore interaction leads to a phase transition between non-avalanching and avalanching regimes of phase-slippage.

Suppression of dendritic growth through the use of solid electrolytes has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. We perform a computational screening of over 12,000 inorganic solids based on their ability to suppress dendrite initiation in contact with Li metal anode. Properties for mechanically isotropic and anisotropic interfaces that can be used in stability criteria for determining the propensity of dendrite initiation are usually obtained from computationally expensive first-principles methods. In order to obtain a large dataset for screening, we use machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of several new solid electrolytes. We train a convolutional neural network on the shear and bulk moduli purely on structural features of the material. We use AdaBoost, Lasso and Bayesian ridge regression to train the elastic constants, where the choice of the model depended on the size of the training data and the noise that it can handle. Our models give us direct interpretability by revealing the dominant structural features affecting the elastic constants. The stiffness is found to increase with a decrease in volume per atom, increase in minimum anion-anion separation, and increase in sublattice (all but Li) packing fraction. Cross-validation/test performance suggests our models generalize well.

Data-driven and machine learning approaches have recently come to the fore to accelerate learnings towards discovery. In this work, we present a simple machine-learning based approach to predict the ionic conductivity of sodium and lithium-based SICON compounds.

Further, for practical applications, both dynamic conductivity as well as static stability must be satisfied at the same time. Therefore, we propose a computational framework that simultaneously optimizes dynamic conductivity and static stability; this is achieved by combining theoretical calculations and the Bayesian multi-objective optimization that is based on the Pareto hyper-volume criterion. Our framework iteratively selects the candidate material, which maximizes the expected increase in the Pareto hyper-volume criterion; this is a standard optimality criterion of multi-objective optimization.

We look in detail at the problem of quasar classification, because identification of a pure quasar sample is necessary to define the Gaia astrometric reference frame. By varying a posterior probability threshold in DSC we can trade off sample completeness and contamination. We show, using our simulated data, that it is possible to achieve a pure sample of quasars (upper limit on contamination of 1 in 40,000) with a completeness of 65% at magnitudes of G=18.5, and 50% at G=20.0, even when quasars have a frequency of only 1 in every 2000 objects. The star sample completeness is simultaneously 99% with a contamination of 0.7%. Including parallax and proper motion in the classifier barely changes the results. We further show that not accounting for class priors in the target population leads to serious misclassifications and poor predictions for sample completeness and contamination.

582,3,0810.3851v1,"We are developing automated systems to provide homogeneous calibration meta-data for heterogeneous imaging data, using the pixel content of the image alone where necessary. Standardized and complete calibration meta-data permit generative modeling: A good model of the sky through wavelength and time--that is, a model of the positions, motions, spectra, and variability of all stellar sources, plus an intensity map of all cosmological sources--could synthesize or generate any astronomical image ever taken at any time with any equipment in any configuration. We argue that the best-fit or highest likelihood model of the data is also the best possible astronomical catalog constructed from those data. A generative model or catalog of this form is the best possible platform for automated discovery, because it is capable of identifying informative failures of the model in new data at the pixel level, or as statistical anomalies in the joint distribution of residuals from many images.

People make catalogues, but because a catalogue requires hard decisions about calibration and detection, no catalogue can contain all of the information in the raw pixels relevant to most scientific investigations. Here we advocate making catalogue-like data outputs that permit investigators to test hypotheses with almost the power of the original image pixels. The key is to provide users with approximations to likelihood tests against the raw image pixels. We advocate three options, in order of increasing difficulty: The first is to define catalogue entries and associated uncertainties such that the catalogue contains the parameters of an approximate description of the image-level likelihood function. The second is to produce a K-catalogue sampling in ""catalogue space"" that samples a posterior probability distribution of catalogues given the data. The third is to expose a web service or equivalent that can re-compute on demand the full image-level likelihood for any user-supplied catalogue.",Telescopes don't make catalogues!
582,5,1011.5770v1,"Star-galaxy classification is one of the most fundamental data-processing tasks in survey astronomy, and a critical starting point for the scientific exploitation of survey data. For bright sources this classification can be done with almost complete reliability, but for the numerous sources close to a survey's detection limit each image encodes only limited morphological information. In this regime, from which many of the new scientific discoveries are likely to come, it is vital to utilise all the available information about a source, both from multiple measurements and also prior knowledge about the star and galaxy populations. It is also more useful and realistic to provide classification probabilities than decisive classifications. All these desiderata can be met by adopting a Bayesian approach to star-galaxy classification, and we develop a very general formalism for doing so. An immediate implication of applying Bayes's theorem to this problem is that it is formally impossible to combine morphological measurements in different bands without using colour information as well; however we develop several approximations that disregard colour information as much as possible. The resultant scheme is applied to data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and tested by comparing the results to deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 measurements of the same sources. The Bayesian classification probabilities obtained from the UKIDSS data agree well with the deep SDSS classifications both overall (a mismatch rate of 0.022, compared to 0.044 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier) and close to the UKIDSS detection limit (a mismatch rate of 0.068 compared to 0.075 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier). The Bayesian formalism developed here can be applied to improve the reliability of any star-galaxy classification schemes based on the measured values of morphology statistics alone.",A Bayesian approach to star-galaxy classification

Animals using such asymmetrical gait thus choose whether the left or the right limb will contact the ground first, and this gives rise to limb preference. Here, we report that dogs (Mammalia, Carnivora) and pikas (Mammalia, Lagomorpha) prefer one forelimb as trailing limb and use it as such almost twice as often as the other. We also show that this choice depends on the individual and is not a characteristic of the species, and that the strength of the preference was not dependent on the animal's running speed.",Limb preference in the gallop of dogs and the half-bound of pikas on   flat ground
583,2,0905.4950v1,"Legged locomotion on flowing ground ({\em e.g.} granular media) is unlike locomotion on hard ground because feet experience both solid- and fluid-like forces during surface penetration. Recent bio-inspired legged robots display speed relative to body size on hard ground comparable to high performing organisms like cockroaches but suffer significant performance loss on flowing materials like sand. In laboratory experiments we study the performance (speed) of a small (2.3 kg) six-legged robot, SandBot, as it runs on a bed of granular media (1 mm poppy seeds). For an alternating tripod gait on the granular bed, standard gait control parameters achieve speeds at best two orders of magnitude smaller than the 2 body lengths/s ($\approx 60$ cm/s) for motion on hard ground. However, empirical adjustment of these control parameters away from the hard ground settings, restores good performance, yielding top speeds of 30 cm/s. Robot speed depends sensitively on the packing fraction $\phi$ and the limb frequency $\omega$, and a dramatic transition from rotary walking to slow swimming occurs when $\phi$ becomes small enough and/or $\omega$ large enough. We propose a kinematic model of the rotary walking mode based on generic features of penetration and slip of a curved limb in granular media. The model captures the dependence of robot speed on limb frequency and the transition between walking and swimming modes but highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the physics of granular media.",Sensitive dependence of the motion of a legged robot on granular media
583,3,1007.0276v2,"Numerous animals live in, and locomote through, subsea soils. To move in a medium dominated by frictional interactions, many of these animals have adopted unique burrowing strategies. This paper presents a burrowing model inspired by the Atlantic razor clam ({\it Ensis directus}), which uses deformations of its body to cyclically loosen and re-pack the surrounding soil in order to locally manipulate burrowing drag. The model reveals how an anisotropic body -- composed of a cylinder and sphere varying sinusoidally in size and relative displacement -- achieves unidirectional motion through a medium with variable frictional properties. This net displacement is attained even though the body kinematics are reciprocal and inertia of both the model organism and the surrounding medium are negligible. Our results indicate that body aspect ratio has a strong effect on burrowing velocity and efficiency, with a well-defined maximum for given kinematics and soil material properties.",Dynamics of digging in wet soil
583,4,1008.1367v1,"Deterministic surfaces are constructs of which profile, topography and textures are integral to the function of the system they enclose. They are designed to yield a predetermined rubbing response. Developing such entities relies on controlling the structure of the rubbing interface so that, not only the surface is of optimized topography, but also is able to self-adjust its behavior according to the evolution of sliding conditions. Inspirations for such designs are frequently encountered in natural species. In particular, and from a tribological point of view, Squamate Reptiles, offer diverse examples where surface texturing, submicron and nano-scale features, achieves frictional regulation. In this paper, we study the frictional response of shed skin obtained from a Python regius snake. The study employed a specially designed tribo-acoustic probe capable of measuring the coefficient of friction and detecting the acoustical behavior of the skin in vivo. The results confirm the anisotropy of the frictional response of snakes. It is found that the coefficient of friction depends on the direction of sliding: the value in forward motion is lower than that in the backward direction. Diagonal and side winding motion induces a different value of the friction coefficient. We discuss the origin of such a phenomenon in relation to surface texturing and study the energy constraints, implied by anisotropic friction, on the motion of the reptile and to establish a reference for comprehending the frictional response we draw a comparison to the friction of human skin.",Characterization of the Frictional Response of Squamata Shed Skin in   Comparison to Human skin

590,2,0708.2715v1,"The article presents calculated dissociative recombination (DR) rate coefficients for H+3 . The previous theoretical work on H+3 was performed using the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation to calculate the target ion vibrational states and it considered just a limited number of ionic rotational states. In this study, we use accurate vibrational wave functions and a larger number of possible rotational states of the H3+ ground vibrational level. The DR rate coefficient obtained is found to agree better with the experimental data from storage-ring experiments than the previous theoretical calculation. We present evidence that excited rotational states could be playing an important role in those experiments for collision energies above 10 meV. The DR rate coefficients calculated separately for ortho- and para-H3+ are predicted to differ significantly at low energy, a result consistent with a recent experiment. We also present DR rate coefficients for vibrationally-excited initial states of H3+, which are found to be somewhat larger than the rate coefficient for the ground vibrational level.",Dissociative recombination of H3+ in the ground and excited vibrational   states

These basis sets are the so-called NMTOs, Muffin Tin Orbitals of order N. For an isolated set of bands, symmetrical orthonormalization of the NMTOs yields a set of Wannier functions which are atom-centered and localized by construction. They are not necessarily maximally localized, but may be transformed into those Wannier functions. For bands which overlap others, Wannier-like functions can be generated. It is shown that NMTOs give a chemical understanding of an extended system. In particular, orbitals for the pi and sigma bands in an insulator, boron nitride, and a semi-metal, graphite, will be considered. In addition, we illustrate that it is possible to obtain Wannier-like functions for only the occupied states in a metallic system by generating NMTOs for cesium.

The major challenge is to synchronize Josephson oscillations in all junctions in the stack to get significant radiation out of the crystal edge parallel to the c axis. We suggest a simple way to solve this problem via artificially prepared lateral modulation of the Josephson critical current identical in all junctions. In such a stack phase oscillations excite the in-phase Fiske mode when the Josephson frequency matches the Fiske-resonance frequency which is set by the stack lateral size. The powerful almost standing electromagnetic wave is excited inside the crystal in the resonance. This wave is homogeneous across the layers meaning that the oscillations are synchronized in all junctions in the stack.

There is a static phase shift between the oscillations in the two subsystems which changes from 0 to $2\pi$ in a narrow region near the stack center.

Combining classical dynamic simulations with a novel ab initio computational approach linear-scalable to molecular interactions involving thousands of atoms, we have investigated the binding of five distinct inhibitors to the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2. We report here that polarization and dynamic hydrogen bonding effects, so far undetected by crystallography, affect both their activity and selectivity. The effects arise from the specific solvation patterns of water molecules in the ATP binding pocket or the intermittent formation of hydrogen bonds during the dynamics of CDK/inhibitor interactions and explain the unexpectedly high potency of certain inhibitors such as 3-(3H-imidazol-4-ylmethylene)-5-methoxy-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one (SU9516). The Lys89 residue in the ATP-binding pocket of CDK2 is observed to form temporary hydrogen bonds with the three most potent inhibitors. This residue is replaced in CDK4 by Thr89, whose shorter side-chain cannot form similar bonds, explaining the relative selectivity of the inhibitors for CDK2.

Our approach naturally includes the use of entangled Gaussian probe states. We prove that the metric enjoys some desirable properties like stability and covariance. As a byproduct, we also obtain some general results in Gaussian channel estimation that are the continuous-variable analogs of previously known results in finite dimensions. We prove that optimal probe states are always pure and bounded in the number of ancillary modes, even in the presence of constraints on the reduced state input in the channel. This has experimental and computational implications: It limits the complexity of optimal experimental setups for channel estimation and reduces the computational requirements for the evaluation of the metric: Indeed, we construct a converging algorithm for its computation.

Motivated by recent experiments, we assume that the oscillator is coupled to a probe qubit via Jaynes-Cummings interaction and that the estimation of its effective temperature is achieved via quantum limited measurements on the qubit. We first consider the ideal unitary evolution in a noiseless environment and then take into account the noise due to non dissipative decoherence. We exploit local quantum estimation theory to assess and optimize the precision of estimation procedures based on the measurement of qubit population, and to compare their performances with the ultimate limit posed by quantum mechanics. In particular, we evaluate the Fisher information (FI) for population measurement, maximize its value over the possible qubit preparations and interaction times, and compare its behavior with that of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We found that the FI for population measurement is equal to the QFI, i.e., population measurement is optimal, for a suitable initial preparation of the qubit and a predictable interaction time. The same configuration also corresponds to the maximum of the QFI itself. Our results indicate that the achievement of the ultimate bound to precision allowed by quantum mechanics is in the capabilities of the current technology.",Qubit thermometry for micromechanical resonators

As the key point of their analysis, they claim that there is not only a Fano interference effect between the impurity d-orbital and the conduction electron continuum, as derived in Ujsaghy et al.

599,2,0509384v1,"We have carried out collinear and non-collinear electronic structure calculations to investigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of isolated Cr atoms, dimers and compact trimers. We find that the Cr monomer prefers to adsrob on the fcc hollow site with a binding energy of 3.13 eV and a magnetic moment of of 3.93 $\mu_B$. The calculated Kondo temperature of 0.7 K for the monomer is consistent with the lack of a Kondo peak in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments at 7 K. The compact Cr dimer orders antiferromagnetically and its bond length contracts to 1.72 $\AA$ close to the value for the free-standing Cr dimer. The very low magnetic moment of 0.005 $\mu_B$ for the Cr atoms in the dimer is due to the strong $d-d$ hybridization between the Cr adatoms. Thus, these calculations reveal that the absence of the Kondo effect observed in STM experiments is due to the small local moments rather than the Kondo quenching of the local moments suggested experimentally. The Cr compact trimer exhibits non-collinear co-planar magnetism with vanishing net magnetic moment in agreement with experiment.",Evolution of magnetism of Cr nanoclusters on a Au(111) surface

Furthermore, we also calculate the tunneling conductance of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and compare our results with recent experiments of Co impurities in the Cu(111) surface.

The TBrPP-Co has a spin-active cobalt atom caged at its center and the interaction between the spin of this cobalt atom and free electrons from the Cu(111) substrate can cause a Kondo resonance. Tunneling spectroscopy data reveal that switching from the saddle to a planar molecular conformation enhances spin-electron coupling, which increases the associated Kondo temperature from 130 K to 170 K.

599,5,0605557v1,"A recent experimental study showed that, distorting a CoPc molecule adsorbed on a Au(111) surface, a Kondo effect is induced with a temperature higher than 200 K. We examine a model in which an atom with strong Coulomb repulsion (Co) is surrounded by four atoms on a square (molecule lobes), and two atoms above and below it representing the apex of the STM tip and an atom on the gold surface (all with a single, half-filled, atomic orbital). The Hamiltonian is solved exactly for the isolated cluster, and, after connecting the leads (STM tip and gold), the conductance is calculated by standard techniques. Quantum interference prevents the existence of the Kondo effect when the orbitals on the square do not interact (undistorted molecule); the Kondo resonance shows up after switching on that interaction.

Spontaneous directional transportation during a long timescale was observed in the symmetrical nanochannel by a ratchet-like mechanism. This ratchet-like system was without any asymmetrical structure or external field, while the asymmetric ratchet-like potential solely resulted from the transported water molecules that formed hydrogen-bonded chains. Remarkably, the resulting net water fluxes reached the level of the biological channel and the average duration for spontaneous directional transportation reached the timescale of many biomolecular functions. This is the first report that heat energy from the surroundings can be used to drive molecules uni-directionally during a long timescale in a nanochannel system.

The transition temperature of the ice-nanotube was shown to take a maximum value of around room temperature with the number of the ring members n=5.

The size of the nanotube allows only a single file of water molecules inside the nanotube. The water molecules inside the nanotube show solid-like ordering at room temperature, which we quantify by calculating the pair correlation function. It is shown that even for the longest observation times, the mode of diffusion of the water molecules inside the nanotube is Fickian and not sub-diffusive. We also propose a one-dimensional random walk model for the diffusion of the water molecules inside the nanotube. We find good agreement between the mean-square displacements calculated from the random walk model and from MD simulations, thereby confirming that the water molecules undergo normal-mode diffusion inside the nanotube. We attribute this behavior to strong positional correlations that cause all the water molecules inside the nanotube to move collectively as a single object.

The influence of the non-equilibrium thermal environment on the confined water cluster has been investigated by imposing a longitudinal temperature gradient to the SWNT. It is demonstrated that the water cluster is transported with the average acceleration proportional to the temperature gradient. Additional equilibrium simulations suggest that the temperature dependence of the potential energy of the confined water is sufficient to realize the transport. Particularly for the system with hydrophobic interface, the water-water intrinsic potential energy appears to play a dominant role. The transport simulations were also performed for a system with a junction between two different SWNTs.

We show that both in mouse and in human these exons show a very clean power law decay in their length distribution and suggest a simple evolutionary model which may explain this finding.

601,3,0811.0499v1,"Life and language are discrete combinatorial systems (DCSs) in which the basic building blocks are finite sets of elementary units: nucleotides or codons in a DNA sequence and letters or words in a language. Different combinations of these finite units give rise to potentially infinite numbers of genes or sentences. This type of DCS can be represented as an Alphabetic Bipartite Network ($\alpha$-BiN) where there are two kinds of nodes, one type represents the elementary units while the other type represents their combinations. There is an edge between a node corresponding to an elementary unit $u$ and a node corresponding to a particular combination $v$ if $u$ is present in $v$. Naturally, the partition consisting of the nodes representing elementary units is fixed, while the other partition is allowed to grow unboundedly.

It is shown that asymptotically the degree distribution of $\alpha$-BiNs can be described as a family of beta distributions. The one-mode projections of the theoretical as well as the real world $\alpha$-BiNs are also studied.

Application of this technique to PhoNet, the co-occurrence network of consonants, not only reveals several natural linguistic principles governing the structure of the consonant inventories, but is also able to quantify their relative importance.

Similarly, for a corpus consisting of texts translated into Polish from other languages the scaling regime is broken more strongly than for a comparable corpus of native Polish texts. Moreover, based on the British National Corpus, we consider the rank-frequency distributions of the grammatically basic forms of words (lemmas) tagged with their proper part of speech.

602,4,1006.1053v1,The quantum well solar cell (QWSC) is a p - i - n solar cell with quantum wells in the intrinsic region. Previous work has shown that QWSCs have a greater open circuit voltage (Voc) than would be provided by a cell with the quantum well effective bandgap. This suggests that the fundamental efficiency limits of QWSCs are greater than those of single bandgap solar cells. The following work investigates QWSCs in the GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs materials system. The design and optimisation of a QWSC in this system requires studies of the voltage and current dependencies on the aluminium fraction. QWSCs with different aluminium fractions have been studied and show an increasing Voc with increasing barrier aluminium composition. The QE however decreases with increasing aluminium composition. We develop a model of the QE to test novel QWSC designs with a view to minimising this problem. This work concentrates on two design changes. The first deals with com- positionally graded structures in which the bandgap varies with position. This bandgap variation introduces an quasi electric field which can be used to increase minority carrier collection in the low efficiency p and n layers. This technique also increases the light flux reaching the highly efficient depletion regions. The second design change consists of coating the back of the cell with a mirror to exploit the portion of light which is not absorbed on the first pass. A model of the QE of compositionally graded QWSC solar cells with back surface mirrors is developed in order to analyse the effect of these design changes. These changes are implemented separately in a number of QWSC designs and the resulting experimental data compared with the model. An optimised design is then presented.,Modelling and Optimising GaAs/Al(x)Ga(1-x)As Multiple Quantum Well Solar   Cells

This paper explores the further advantage afforded by the indication that QWSCs operate in the radiative limit because radiative contribution to the dark current is seen to dominate in experimental data at biases corresponding to operation under concentration. The dark currents of QWSCs are analysed in terms of a light and dark current model. The model calculates the spectral response (QE) from field bearing regions and charge neutral layers and from the quantum wells by calculating the confined densities of states and absorption coefficient, and solving transport equations analytically. The total dark current is expressed as the sum of depletion layer and charge neutral radiative and non radiative currents consistent with parameter values extracted from QE fits to data. The depletion layer dark current is a sum of Shockley-Read-Hall non radiative, and radiative contributions. The charge neutral region contribution is expressed in terms of the ideal Shockley radiative and non-radiative currents modified to include surface recombination. This analysis shows that the QWSC is inherently subject to the fundamental radiative efficiency limit at high currents where the radiative dark current dominates, whereas good homojunction cells are well described by the ideal Shockley picture where the limit is determined by radiative and non radiative recombination in the charge neutral layers of the cell.",Efficiency limits of quantum well solar cells

This is valid for all values of the particle's momentum, including the case of however slow particles. All three times are also considered for a resonant tunneling. In all the cases the main feature to distinguish our concept from others is that the average starting point of transmitted (reflected) particles does not coincide with that of all particles. One has to stress here that there is no such an experiment which would give coordinates of all the three points, simultaneously.

In this paper we provide a thorough pedagogical description of the phase space structures that are responsible for controlling transport in these problems. Of central importance is the existence of a \emph{Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold (NHIM)}, whose \emph{stable and unstable manifolds} have sufficient dimensionality to act as separatrices, partitioning energy surfaces into regions of qualitatively distinct behavior. This NHIM forms the natural (dynamical) equator of a (spherical) \emph{dividing surface} which locally divides an energy surface into two components (`reactants' and `products'), one on either side of the bottleneck. This dividing surface has all the desired properties sought for in \emph{transition state theory} where reaction rates are computed from the flux through a dividing surface. In fact, the dividing surface that we construct is crossed exactly once by reactive trajectories, and not crossed by nonreactive trajectories, and related to these properties, minimizes the flux upon variation of the dividing surface.   We discuss three presentations of the energy surface and the phase space structures contained in it for 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in the threedimensional space $\R^3$, and two schematic models which capture many of the essential features of the dynamics for $n$-DoF systems.

This ensemble of trajectories is sampled using algorithms borrowed from transition path sampling, a method originally developed to study rare transitions between long-lived states. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to several systems with numbers of degrees of freedom ranging from one to several hundred and in all cases the algorithm found rare pathways with atypical chaoticity.

For the case of distributed parameter models, material properties are calculated according to the mean temperature at each segment of a sectioned device. A couple of important advantages of the presented models are that temperature dependence of material properties is considered and that they can be easily simulated using an electronic simulation tool such as SPICE. Comparisons are made between SPICE simulations for a single-pellet module using the proposed models and with numerical simulations carried out with Mathematica software.

We prove that in the limit of a very thin sample of arbitrary shape, there exist van der Pauw formulae relating particular linear combinations of the potential and temperature differences between points on the edges of the sample. We show that the Harman figure of merit can be radically different from the intrinsic figures of merit of the material, and can often be substantially enhanced.

While based on the concept of the ""charge"" polarization, the same theory can be used as an elegant tool to characterize the Bloch bands of neutral bosonic systems such as photonic or phononic crystals. Recently, the theory of this quantized polarization was extended from the dipole- to higher multipole-moments. In particular, a two-dimensional quantized quadrupole insulator is predicted to have gapped yet topological one-dimensional edge-modes, which in turn stabilize zero-dimensional in-gap corner states. However, such a state of matter has not been observed experimentally. Here, we provide the first measurements of a phononic quadrupole insulator. We experimentally characterize the bulk, edge, and corner physics of a mechanical metamaterial and find the predicted gapped edge and in-gap corner states. We further corroborate our findings by comparing the mechanical properties of a topologically non-trivial system to samples in other phases predicted by the quadrupole theory.

Conventional force models, which have large cutoffs, are nonperturbative because of strong short-range repulsion, the iterated tensor interaction, and the presence of bound or nearly-bound states. But for low-momentum interactions with cutoffs around 2 fm^{-1}, the softened potential combined with Pauli blocking leads to corrections in nuclear matter in the particle-particle channel that are well converged at second order in the potential, suggesting that perturbation theory can be used in place of Brueckner resummations. Calculations of nuclear matter using the low-momentum two-nucleon force V_{low k} with a corresponding leading-order three-nucleon (3N) force from chiral effective field theory (EFT) exhibit nuclear binding in the Hartree-Fock approximation, and become less cutoff dependent with the inclusion of the dominant second-order contributions.

613,1,1410.4558v3,"We study the effect of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on bound states induced by impurities in superconductors. The presence of spin-orbit coupling breaks the $\mathbb{SU}(2)$-spin symmetry and causes the superconducting order parameter to have generically both singlet (s-wave) and triplet (p-wave) components. We find that in the presence of SOC the spectrum of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states is qualitatively different in s-wave and p-wave superconductor, a fact that can be used to identify the superconducting pairing symmetry of the host system. We also predict that in the presence of SOC the spectrum of the impurity-induced bound states depends on the orientation of the magnetic moment $\bf{S}$ of the impurity and, in particular, that by changing the orientation of $\bf{S}$ the fermion-parity of the lowest energy bound state can be tuned. We then study the case of a dimer of magnetic impurities and show that in this case the YSR spectrum for a p-wave superconductor is qualitatively very different from the one for an s-wave superconductor even in the limit of vanishing SOC.

The drop occurs as the spin-polarized impurity band crosses the Fermi level and is associated with a quantum phase transition first put forward by Sakurai for the single impurity case. Taking into account that the background magnetic field created by the ordered impurity moments enters as a Zeeman shift, we find that the superconducting phase transition changes from second order to first order for high enough impurity concentration.",Spectral properties of superconductors with ferromagnetically ordered   magnetic impurities
613,4,1605.02657v2,"Conventional superconductors disordered by magnetic impurities demonstrate physical properties drastically different from their pristine counterparts. In our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 92, 245430 (2015)] we explored spectral and thermodynamic properties of such systems for two extreme cases: completely random and ferromagnetically aligned impurity magnetic moments. Here we consider transport properties of these systems, and show that they have a potential to be used in superconducting spintronic devices. Each magnetic impurity contributes a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound state to the spectrum, residing at sub-gap energies. Provided the YSR states form metallic bands, we demonstrate that the tunneling current carried by these states can be highly spin-polarized when the impurities are ferromagnetically ordered. The spin polarization can be switched by simply tuning the bias voltage. Moreover, even when the impurity spins are completely uncorrelated, one can still achieve almost 100% spin polarization of the current, if the tunnel interface is spin-active. We compute electric current and noise, varying parameters of the interface between tunneling and fully transparent regimes, and analyze the relative role of single-particle and Andreev reflection processes.",Spin-polarized currents and noise in NS junctions with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov   impurities

In particular, we confirm the existence of a `self-organized' 1D topologically non-trivial superconducting phase within the set of subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states formed along the magnetic chain. This phase is stabilized by incommensurate spiral correlations within the magnetic chain that arise from the competition between short-range ferromagnetic and long-range antiferromagnetic electron-induced exchange interactions, similar to a recent study for a 3D superconductor [M. Schecter et al. Phys. Rev. B 93, 140503(R) 2016]. The exchange interaction along diagonal directions are also considered and found to display behavior similar to a 1D substrate when close to half filling. We show that the topological phase diagram is robust against local superconducting order parameter suppression and weak substrate spin-orbit coupling. Lastly, we study the effect of a direct ferromagnetic exchange coupling between the adatoms, and find the region of spiral order in the phase diagram to be significantly enlarged in a wide range of the direct exchange coupling.",Spiral magnetic order and topological superconductivity in a chain of   magnetic adatoms on a two-dimensional superconductor

We show numerically that the spatial distribution of dissipation can be described by Log-Poisson statistics which leads to extended self-similarity (ESS).

617,1,0505021v3,"We present a theory for the memory effect in electron glasses. In fast gate voltage sweeps it is manifested as a dip in the conductivity around the equilibration gate voltage. We show that this feature, also known as anomalous field effect, arises from the long-time persistence of correlations in the electronic configuration. We argue that the gate voltage at which the memory dip saturates is related to an instability caused by the injection of a critical number of excess carriers. This saturation threshold naturally increases with temperature. On the other hand, we argue that the gate voltage beyond which memory is erased, is temperature independent. Using standard percolation arguments, we calculate the anomalous field effect as a function of gate voltage, temperature, carrier density and disorder. Our results are consistent with experiments, and in particular, they reproduce the observed scaling of the width of the memory dip with various parameters.",The Memory Effect in Electron Glasses
617,2,0505744v1,"The combination of strong disorder and many-body interactions in Anderson insulators lead to a variety of intriguing non-equilibrium transport phenomena. These include slow relaxation and a variety of memory effects characteristic of glasses. Here we show that when such systems are driven with sufficiently high current, and in liquid helium bath, a peculiar type of conductance noise can be observed. This noise appears in the conductance versus time traces as downward-going spikes. The characteristic features of the spikes (such as typical width) and the threshold current at which they appear are controlled by the sample parameters. We show that this phenomenon is peculiar to hopping transport and does not exist in the diffusive regime. Observation of conductance spikes hinges also on the sample being in direct contact with the normal phase of liquid helium; when this is not the case, the noise exhibits the usual 1/f characteristics independent of the current drive. A model based on the percolative nature of hopping conductance explains why the onset of the effect is controlled by current density. It also predicts the dependence on disorder as confirmed by our experiments. To account for the role of the bath, the hopping transport model is augmented by a heuristic assumption involving nucleation of cavities in the liquid helium in which the sample is immersed. The suggested scenario is analogous to the way high-energy particles are detected in a Glaser's bubble chamber.",Conductance noise in interacting Anderson insulators driven far from   equilibrium
617,3,0506022v2,"Aging, which manifests itself as an irreversible increase in electrical resistance in island metal films is of considerable interest from both academic as well as applications point of view. Aging is attributed to various causes, oxidation of islands and mobility of islands followed by coalescence (mobility coalescence) being the main contenders. The effect of parameters like substrate temperature, substrate cleaning, residual gases in the vacuum chamber, ultrasonic vibration of the substrate, suggest that the mobility coalescence is responsible for the aging in island metal films. Electron microscopy studies show evidence for mobility of islands at high substrate temperatures. The comparison of aging data of island silver films deposited on glass substrates in ultra high vacuum and high vacuum suggests that the oxidation of islands, as being responsible for aging in these films, can be ruled out. Further, under certain conditions of deposition, island silver films exhibit a dramatic and drastic fall in electrical resistance, marking the insulator-metal transition. This interesting transition observed in a conservative system - after the stoppage of deposition of the film- is a clear evidence for mobility coalescence of islands even at room temperature. The sudden fall in resistance is preceded by fluctuations in resistance with time and fluctuations are attributed to the making and breaking of the percolation path in the film.",Insulator-metal transition in a conservative system: An evidence for   mobility coalescence in island silver films

618,4,1812.01041v2,"The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its promise for near-term quantum applications, not much is currently understood about QAOA's performance beyond its lowest-depth variant. An essential but missing ingredient for understanding and deploying QAOA is a constructive approach to carry out the outer-loop classical optimization. We provide an in-depth study of the performance of QAOA on MaxCut problems by developing an efficient parameter-optimization procedure and revealing its ability to exploit non-adiabatic operations. Building on observed patterns in optimal parameters, we propose heuristic strategies for initializing optimizations to find quasi-optimal $p$-level QAOA parameters in $O(\text{poly}(p))$ time, whereas the standard strategy of random initialization requires $2^{O(p)}$ optimization runs to achieve similar performance. We then benchmark QAOA and compare it with quantum annealing, especially on difficult instances where adiabatic quantum annealing fails due to small spectral gaps. The comparison reveals that QAOA can learn via optimization to utilize non-adiabatic mechanisms to circumvent the challenges associated with vanishing spectral gaps. Finally, we provide a realistic resource analysis on the experimental implementation of QAOA. When quantum fluctuations in measurements are accounted for, we illustrate that optimization will be important only for problem sizes beyond numerical simulations, but accessible on near-term devices.

However in 2002 the actual 1887 fringe shift data was analysed for the first time with a theory for the Michelson interferometer that used both the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction effect, as well as the effect of the air in the interferometer on the speed of light. That analysis showed that the data gave an absolute motion speed in excess of 300km/s. So far six other experiments have been shown to give the same result.

In this derivation, the wave-particle duality of photons in the theory of special relativity is considered. The dilation of time of a moving clock, which is derived from the Lorentz transformation that depends on the velocity of the moving clock in the reference frame at rest, and wavefront counting by geometrical drawing are used to describe the longitudinal Doppler shift.

621,4,0508174v1,"Physics textbooks assert that in the famous interferometer 1887 experiment to detect absolute motion Michelson and Morley saw no rotation-induced fringe shifts - the signature of absolute motion; it was a null experiment. However this is incorrect. Their published data revealed to them the expected fringe shifts, but that data gave a speed of some 8km/s using a Newtonian theory for the calibration of the interferometer, and so was rejected by them solely because it was less than the 30km/s orbital speed of the earth. A 2002 post relativistic-effects analysis for the operation of the device however gives a different calibration leading to a speed >300km/s. So this experiment detected both absolute motion and the breakdown of Newtonian physics. So far another six experiments have confirmed this first detection of absolute motion in 1887.",The Michelson and Morley 1887 Experiment and the Discovery of Absolute   Motion
621,5,0512036v2,"We have realized that under Lorentz transformations the tick number of a moving common clock remains unchanged, that is, the hand of the clock never runs slow, but the time interval between its two consecutive ticks contracts, so the relative time has to be recorded by using the tau-clocks required by the transformations, instead of unreal slowing clocks. Thus it is argued that using rest common clocks or the equivalent the measured velocity of light emitted by a moving source, which is quasi-velocity of foreign light, is dependent of the source velocity. Nevertheless, the velocity of foreign light that should be measured by using tau-clocks is independent of the source velocity. The velocity of native light emitted by a rest source obeys the postulate of relativity in accordance with both Maxwell equations and the result of Michelson-Morley experiment. On the other hand, the velocity of foreign light obeys both Ritz's emission theory except the Lorentz factor and the postulate of constancy of light velocity if measured by using tau-clocks. Thus the emission theory does not conflict with special relativity. The present argument leads to a logical consequence that the so-called positive conclusions from experiments testing constancy of the velocity of light emitted by moving sources if using common clocks or the equivalent, instead of tau-clocks, exactly contradicts Lorentz transformations.",Attempt at clarification of Einstein's postulate of constancy of light   velocity

This is especially true at the weak noise where many systems operate and where coding performance is difficult to estimate because of the diminishingly small number of errors.

It is known that the predictions of the density evolution (DE) can fairly explain the detection dynamics only in the case where the detection dynamics converge. At transients, though, the predictions of DE systematically deviate from computer simulation results. Furthermore, when the detection dynamics fail to convergence, the deviation of the predictions of DE from the results of numerical experiments becomes large. As an alternative, generating functional analysis (GFA) can take into account the effect of the Onsager reaction term exactly and does not need the Gaussian assumption of the local field.

The aim of this study is to determine whether As gets into the bulk of gypsum and calcite structures or is simply adsorbed on the surface. Different mechanisms of substitution are used as hypotheses. The combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and x-ray diffraction data shows an expansion of the unit cell volume proportional to the As concentration within the samples.

625,3,0801.0460v1,"The formation of solid calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from aqueous solutions or slurries containing calcium and carbon dioxide (CO2) is a complex process of considerable importance in the ecological, geochemical and biological areas. Moreover, the demand for powdered CaCO3 has increased considerably recently in various fields of industry. The aim of this study was therefore to synthesize fine particles of calcite with controlled morphology by hydrothermal carbonation of calcium hydroxide at high CO2 pressure (initial PCO2=55 bar) and at moderate and high temperature (30 and 90 degrees C). The morphology of precipitated particles was identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM/EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS). In addition, an X-ray diffraction analysis was performed to investigate the carbonation efficiency and purity of the solid product. Carbonation of dispersed calcium hydroxide in the presence of supercritical (PT=90 bar, T=90 degrees C) or gaseous (PT=55 bar, T=30 degrees C) CO2 led to the precipitation of sub-micrometric isolated particles (<1$\mu$m) and micrometric agglomerates (<5$\mu$m) of calcite. For this study, the carbonation efficiency (Ca(OH)2-CaCO3 conversion) was not significantly affected by PT conditions after 24 h of reaction. In contrast, the initial rate of calcium carbonate precipitation increased from 4.3 mol/h in the ""90bar-90 degrees C"" system to 15.9 mol/h in the ""55bar-30 degrees C"" system. The use of high CO2 pressure may therefore be desirable for increasing the production rate of CaCO3, carbonation efficiency and purity, to approximately 48 kg/m3h, 95% and 96.3%, respectively in this study. The dissipated heat for this exothermic reaction was estimated by calorimetry to be -32 kJ/mol in the ""90bar-90 degrees C"" system and -42 kJ/mol in the ""55bar-30 degrees C"" system.",Rhombohedral calcite precipitation from CO2-H2O-Ca(OH)2 slurry under   supercritical and gas CO2 media
625,4,0801.1738v1,"Sorption of As(III) by calcite was investigated as a function of As(III) concentration, time and pH. The sorption isotherm, i.e. the log As(III) vs. log [As(OH)3 degrees / Assat] plot is S-shaped and has been modelled on an extended version of the surface precipitation model. At low concentrations, As(OH)3 degrees is adsorbed by complexation to surface Ca surface sites, as previously described by the X-ray standing wave technique. The inflexion point of the isotherm, where As(OH)3 degrees is limited by the amount of surface sites (ST), yields 6 sites nm-2 in good agreement with crystallographic data. Beyond this value, the amount of sorbed arsenic increases linearly with solution concentration, up to the saturation of arsenic with respect to the precipitation of CaHAsO3(s). The solid solutions formed in this concentration range were examined by X-ray and neutron diffraction. The doped calcite lattice parameters increase with arsenic content while c/a ratio remains constant.

This method allows a high carbonation efficiency (about 95% of Ca(OH)2-CaCO3 conversion), a significant production rate (48 kg/m3 h) and high purity of product (about 96%). However, the various initial physicochemical conditions have a strong influence on the crystal size and surface area of the synthesized calcite crystals. The present study is focused on the estimation of the textural properties of synthesized calcite (morphology, specific surface area, average particle size, particle size distribution and particle size evolution with reaction time), using Rietveld refinements of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations. This study demonstrate that the pressure, the temperature and the dissolved quantity of CO2 have a significant effect on the average particle size, specific surface area, initial rate of precipitation, and on the morphology of calcium carbonate crystals. In contrast, these PTx conditions used herein have an insignificant effect on the carbonation efficiency of Ca(OH)2.

627,3,0508181v4,"The understanding of the universe is confused by the unknown nature of about 95% of its matter, required to confine the motions of space objects in cosmic structures. The idea of this paper is that the self-similar transformations of one postulated basic matter create the fundamental dynamic fractal elements of the universe. The elements are described with equation of unifying interaction drawn into their fundamental framework. The equation transforms into the inverse square laws, the principle of uncertainty, Maxwell equations of electromagnetic field and into MOND like expression after modification of its parameters at the scales where these laws and principle are found to hold. The introduced equation is also confirmed with calculations based on the orbital data for bodies that move around the nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, the centers of the Earth and the Sun and orbit the huge 87 Sylvia asteroid. The puzzling constant sunward force that acts on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft, the flat rotational curves of stars far from the galactic nuclei, the nature of dark matter and the enigmatic cosmic repulsion are explained in terms of contracting and expanding 3D-spirally-faster-inward-oscillating vortexes of basic matter, called dynamic fractals. The latter create new fundamental framework, which allows qualitative and quantitative modeling by fitting of the parameters of the equation of unifying interaction to experimental data.

628,2,0602446v1,"In this article we review a less known unperturbative and powerful many-body method in the framework of classical statistical mechanics and then we show how it works by means of explicit calculations for a nontrivial classical model. The formalism of two-time Green functions in classical statistical mechanics is presented in a form parallel to the well known quantum counterpart, focusing on the spectral properties which involve the important concept of spectral density. Furthermore, the general ingredients of the classical spectral density method (CSDM) are presented with insights for systematic nonperturbative approximations to study conveniently the macroscopic properties of a wide variety of classical many-body systems also involving phase transitions. The method is implemented by means of key ideas for exploring the spectrum of elementary excitations and the damping effects within a unified formalism. Then, the effectiveness of the CSDM is tested with explicit calculations for the classical $d$-dimensional spin-$S$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model with long-range exchange interactions decaying as $r^{-p}$ ($p>d$) with distance $r$ between spins and in the presence of an external magnetic field. The analysis of the thermodynamic and critical properties, performed by means of the CSDM to the lowest order of approximation, shows clearly that nontrivial results can be obtained in a relatively simple manner already to this lower stage. The basic spectral density equations for the next higher order level are also presented and the damping of elementary spin excitations in the low temperature regime is studied.

629,3,0710.0582v1,"Recent theory predicted that the Quantum Spin Hall Effect, a fundamentally novel quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We have fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we can tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to the p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d < 6.3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d > 6.3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e^2/h. The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nm, is also independently determined from the magnetic field induced insulator to metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.",Quantum Spin Hall Insulator State in HgTe Quantum Wells
629,4,0801.0901v1,"The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells. By varying the thickness of the quantum well, the band structure changes from a normal to an ""inverted"" type at a critical thickness $d_c$. We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin quantum wells with well width $d_{QW}< 6.3$ nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells ($d_{QW}> 6.3$ nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to $2e^2/h$. The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field.

629,5,0801.2831v1,"The quantum spin Hall (QSH) state is a topologically non-trivial state of quantum matter which preserves time-reversal symmetry; it has an energy gap in the bulk, but topologically robust gapless states at the edge. Recently, this novel effect has been predicted and observed in HgTe quantum wells. In this work we predict a similar effect arising in Type-II semiconductor quantum wells made from InAs/GaSb/AlSb. Because of a rare band alignment the quantum well band structure exhibits an ""inverted"" phase similar to CdTe/HgTe quantum wells, which is a QSH state when the Fermi level lies inside the gap. Due to the asymmetric structure of this quantum well, the effects of inversion symmetry breaking and inter-layer charge transfer are essential. By standard self-consistent calculations, we show that the QSH state persists when these corrections are included, and a quantum phase transition between the normal insulator and the QSH phase can be electrically tuned by the gate voltage.",Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Inverted Type II Semiconductors

Arneodo and collaborators have suggested that the ensemble average of DLA cluster density should be close to the noise-free selected Saffman-Taylor finger. We show that a different, but related, ensemble average, that of the conformal maps associated with random clusters, yields a non-trivial shape which is also not far from the Saffman-Taylor finger. However, we have previously demonstrated that the same average of DLA in a channel geometry is not the Saffman-Taylor finger. This casts doubt on the idea that the average of noisy diffusion-limited growth is governed by a simple transcription of noise-free results.","Random walks, diffusion limited aggregation in a wedge, and average   conformal maps"
630,3,0501645v2,"We explore the macroscopic consequences of lattice anisotropy for Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) in three dimensions. Simple cubic and BCC lattice growths are shown to approach universal asymptotic states in a coherent fashion, and the approach is accelerated by the use of noise reduction. These states are strikingly anisotropic dendrites with a rich hierarchy of structure. For growth on an FCC lattice, our data suggest at least two stable fixed points of anisotropy, one matching the BCC case. Hexagonal growths, favouring six planar and two polar directions, appear to approach a line of asymptotic states with continuously tunable polar anisotropy. The more planar of these growths visually resemble real snowflake morphologies.   Our simulations use a new and dimension-independent implementation of the Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) model. The algorithm maintains a hierarchy of sphere-coverings of the growth, supporting efficient random walks onto the growth by spherical moves. Anisotropy was introduced by restricting growth to certain preferred directions.",Anisotropic diffusion limited aggregation in three dimensions -   universality and non-universality
630,4,0504338v2,"We test the multiscaling issue of DLA clusters using a modified algorithm. This algorithm eliminates killing the particles at the death circle. Instead, we return them to the birth circle at a random relative angle taken from the evaluated distribution. In addition, we use a two-level hierarchical memory model that allows using large steps in conjunction with an off-lattice realization of the model. Our algorithm still seems to stay in the framework of the original DLA model. We present an accurate estimate of the fractal dimensions based on the data for a hundred clusters with 50 million particles each. We find that multiscaling cannot be ruled out. We also find that the fractal dimension is a weak self-averaging quantity. In addition, the fractal dimension, if calculated using the harmonic measure, is a nonmonotonic function of the cluster radius. We argue that the controversies in the data interpretation can be due to the weak self-averaging and the influence of intrinsic noise.",Test of multiscaling in DLA model using an off-lattice killing-free   algorithm
630,5,0504526v2,"In this work, the transition between diffusion-limited and ballistic aggregation models was revisited using a model in which biased random walks simulate the particle trajectories. The bias is controlled by a parameter $\lambda$, which assumes the value $\lambda=0$ (1) for ballistic (diffusion-limited) aggregation model. Patterns growing from a single seed were considered. In order to simulate large clusters, a new efficient algorithm was developed. For $\lambda \ne 0$, the patterns are fractal on the small length scales, but homogeneous on the large ones. We evaluated the mean density of particles $\bar{\rho}$ in the region defined by a circle of radius $r$ centered at the initial seed. As a function of $r$, $\bar{\rho}$ reaches the asymptotic value $\rho_0(\lambda)$ following a power law $\bar{\rho}=\rho_0+Ar^{-\gamma}$ with a universal exponent $\gamma=0.46(2)$, independent of $\lambda$. The asymptotic value has the behavior $\rho_0\sim|1-\lambda|^\beta$, where $\beta= 0.26(1)$. The characteristic crossover length that determines the transition from DLA- to BA-like scaling regimes is given by $\xi\sim|1-\lambda|^{-\nu}$, where $\nu=0.61(1)$, while the cluster mass at the crossover follows a power law $M_\xi\sim|1 -\lambda|^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha=0.97(2)$.

We calculate the maximum likelihood estimator, and compute its asymptotic mean-squared-error via the Fisher information. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is known to be simply related to the Fisher information under idealised detection, we find the two measures of precision differ markedly for a split detector. We show that a greater signal-to-noise ratio 'before' the detector leads to a greater information penalty, unless adaptive realignment is used. We find that with an initially balanced split detector, tuning the normalised difference in counts to 0.884753... gives the highest posterior Fisher information, and that this provides an improvement by at least a factor of about 2.5 over operating in the usual linear regime. We discuss the implications for weak-value amplification, a popular probabilistic signal amplification technique.",Fisher information vs. signal-to-noise ratio for a split detector
631,3,1511.00552v3,"Rayleigh's criterion for resolving two incoherent point sources has been the most influential measure of optical imaging resolution for over a century. In the context of statistical image processing, violation of the criterion is especially detrimental to the estimation of the separation between the sources, and modern farfield superresolution techniques rely on suppressing the emission of close sources to enhance the localization precision. Using quantum optics, quantum metrology, and statistical analysis, here we show that, even if two close incoherent sources emit simultaneously, measurements with linear optics and photon counting can estimate their separation from the far field almost as precisely as conventional methods do for isolated sources, rendering Rayleigh's criterion irrelevant to the problem. Our results demonstrate that superresolution can be achieved not only for fluorophores but also for stars.",Quantum Theory of Superresolution for Two Incoherent Optical Point   Sources
631,4,1512.08304v2,"A novel interferometric method - SLIVER (Super Localization by Image inVERsion interferometry) - is proposed for estimating the separation of two incoherent point sources with a mean squared error that does not deteriorate as the sources are brought closer. The essential component of the interferometer is an image inversion device that inverts the field in the transverse plane about the optical axis, assumed to pass through the centroid of the sources. The performance of the device is analyzed using the Cram\'er-Rao bound applied to the statistics of spatially-unresolved photon counting using photon number-resolving and on-off detectors. The analysis is supported by Monte-Carlo simulations of the maximum likelihood estimator for the source separation, demonstrating the superlocalization effect for separations well below that set by the Rayleigh criterion. Simulations indicating the robustness of SLIVER to mismatch between the optical axis and the centroid are also presented. The results are valid for any imaging system with a circularly symmetric point-spread function.",Interferometric superlocalization of two incoherent optical point   sources

In particular, we present a new proposal function for equilibrium sampling of paths with a Monte-Carlo dynamics (the so-called ``brownian tube'' proposal). This proposal is based on the continuity of the dynamics with respect to the random forcing, and generalizes all previous approaches. The efficiency of this proposal is demonstrated using some measure of decorrelation in path space. We also discuss a switching strategy that allows to transform ensemble of paths at a finite rate while remaining at equilibrium, in contrast with the usual Jarzynski like switching. This switching is very interesting to sample constrained paths starting from unconstrained paths, or to perform simulated annealing in a rigorous way.",Path sampling with Stochastic Dynamics: Some new Algorithms
632,2,0609001v3,"We demonstrate the use of a variational method to determine a quantitative lower bound on the rate of convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms as a function of the target density and proposal density. The bound relies on approximating the second largest eigenvalue in the spectrum of the MCMC operator using a variational principle and the approach is applicable to problems with continuous state spaces. We apply the method to one dimensional examples with Gaussian and quartic target densities, and we contrast the performance of the Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) algorithm with a ``smart'' variant that incorporates gradient information into the trial moves. We find that the variational method agrees quite closely with numerical simulations. We also see that the smart MCMC algorithm often fails to converge geometrically in the tails of the target density except in the simplest case we examine, and even then care must be taken to choose the appropriate scaling of the deterministic and random parts of the proposed moves. Again, this calls into question the utility of smart MCMC in more complex problems. Finally, we apply the same method to approximate the rate of convergence in multidimensional Gaussian problems with and without importance sampling. There we demonstrate the necessity of importance sampling for target densities which depend on variables with a wide range of scales.",Variational method for estimating the rate of convergence of Markov   Chain Monte Carlo algorithms

The sampling technique makes use of pre-existing information (which can safely be of low or uncertain quality) relating to the distribution from which it is desired to sample. This information should come in the form of a ``bank'' or ``cache'' of space points of which at least some may be expected to be near regions of interest in the desired distribution. In practical circumstances such ``banks of clues'' are easy to assemble from earlier work, aborted runs, discarded burn-in samples from failed sampling attempts, or from prior scouting investigations. The technique equilibrates between disconnected parts of the distribution without user input.

At a second-order (and possibly first-order) transition a pseudoGoldstone boson becomes massless as a consequence of a spontaneous change in the discrete, but not the continuous, symmetry of the ground state. We relate the masslessness of these ``accidental Goldstone bosons'' (AGBs) bosons to singularities of the order parameter for the phase transition. The relative frequency of CP-phase transitions makes it commonplace for the AGBs to be light, much lighter than their underlying strong interaction scale.
